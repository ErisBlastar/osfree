IXF Manager implementation
==========================

IXF Manager provides following interface:

IFXIdentifyModule  - identifies module format in memory and fills IXFModule
                     structure.
IXFLoadModule      - parses module format in memory
                     and fills information about imports and exports.
IXFFixup           - resolves fixups. This function must be
                     executed AFTER all required modules will be loaded.

This document describes how IXF manager work on LX IXF example.

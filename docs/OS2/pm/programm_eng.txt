Fundamental concepts
-----------------------
client - separate program of clients can be several on several computers. 
       Client - program, kotoroya into nast.vremya has application type Window
      
server - server, who operates clients server otoborazhayet the picture of 
       desktopa on one or several devices server transfers communications from 
	   desktopa to clients, also, between the clients	  	 

the number of client, issued by server after connecting with the client

HAB - handle ancor block - the index of thread, which issues and server stores. 
      During the transmittal to the client of index the server checks the presence 
	  in list of client and thread ordinal. 
	  Index is an index of the element of the massif of structure _FreePM_HABserverinf 
	  see also client structure _FreePM_HABinf	     

HWND - handle window the index of window, issued by server to client. Index is an 
      index of the element of the massif of structure struct WND	  

DC - divays context. khz that this is such in ibiyemerov. the index of the massif of 
     structures F_.DC. structure contains the number of divaysa, khendl of window. 
	 to?eshche what- thread.	  

HPS - Handle Presentation Space. the index of the massif of structures F_PS, which 
     does contain DC, the current color, the current type of line, the current 
	 initial point? something, that describes the geometry of the visible range of window?.	 

the communication they can be transferred between the windows if communication must 
     be transmitted between the windows of one client, then it does not exceed the 
	 limits of the client	 
	 
Turn of the communications	 
     there is on the server and on the client
	 
===========================================================================
As all this works. 
Server gives out ihab'y and hwnd - indices of threads and windows. 
Windows obtain communications.
Communications are obtained either from the turns, attached to ihab or directly, 
to esle they send from the same thread, or nenapryamuyu, but without the accomodation 
of vochered', if they send from another thread of process. 
Nenapryamuyu - means it is caused the procedure of window inside WinGetMsg.
If communication is sent to another process, it is sent through server. 
If send - first it awaits, if Post, then it pushes in the turn of process, 
furthermore vnutryakh WinGetMsg


Server
along the demand of client F_CMD_GET_IHAB issues free ihab, and clientId

As to write the programs: 
Is taken iskhodnik for PM they are corrected inkludy 
with os2.h on F_OS2.hpp and defayny with INCL_DOS, INCL_WIN 
on F_INCL_DOS, F_INCL_WIN is added #include "PM_FPM.h" and we add into the project 
the client libraries FreePM.

Reverse compatability. So that the program for FreePM could work under PM and in 
order not to change all calls F_xxx to WinXXX or GpiXXX we add into the project 
the file of \FreePM\lib\PMcompat\PM_api.cpp

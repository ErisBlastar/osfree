Binary File Format
------------------------------

Binary File Format (BFF) is a language for describing executable formats which can be used by loader.
BFF was started as reimplementation of Simple Retargetable Loader (SRL) by David Ung 
(http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~cristina/students/david/honoursThesis96/table.htm). SRL originaly
was very simple loader and supported DOS MZ, Windows NE and Solaris ELF. Unfortunately
no publicaly available sources. I (prokushev) tried to implement SRL from scratch, but some
problems was visible during attempt to make OS/2 LX support. So, this document is attempt to
describe practical usage of BFF for loader implementation.

Our primary goal is to provide mechanizm for IXF generation (see ixf.txt for more datails about IXF).
IXF requires file format identification routine, image loading routine and fixup routine. This ducument
tries to formulate gramma of BFF for such reasons.

Format identification
---------------------------------

All know for me formats can be identified by signatures. In most cases executable formats has one signature.
But formats like LX, LE, PE, NE, etc. has 2 or 1 signatures. Classically they contains DOS code and other
OS code. We need to parse only non-DOS code. So we need construction to point sequence of signatures.

signature: SIGNATURE string ADDRESS expression
	| signature AND string ADDRESS expression
	;

So, description of pure LX is

SIGNATURE "LX" ADDRESS 0

Description of LX with MZ

SIGNATURE "MZ" ADDRESS 0 AND "LX" ADDRESS e32_magiclo

and description of LX structure required, of course. But such gramma has some limitations, so we need to
extend it to allow things like ZM signature instead of MZ (this is possible according many docs).

signature: SIGNATURE string_expression ADDRESS expression
	| signature AND string_expression ADDRESS expression
	;

string_expression: string
	| string_expression OR string
	;

SIGNATURE "MZ" OR "ZM" ADDRESS 0 AND "LX" ADDRESS e32_magiclo

But such logic also not enough for detecting pure LX without MZ header. So, BFF can
contain more then one SIGNATURE string.

Final signature detection is

SIGNATURE "MZ" OR "ZM" ADDRESS 0 AND "LX" ADDRESS e32_magiclo 
SIGNATURE "LX" ADDRESS 0

ELF signature detection is

SIGNATURE "\0x7fELF" ADDRESS 0

# Strange, the server crashes with debug build! No, it crashes for some else reason.
# Found it! To little heapsize! Was only 287 KiB while it assumed 2.6 MiB!
# It must be set with stack= not with heapsize= !
# Changing the stack size has no effect at all.
# Increased the stack for threads
# 65 KiB from 32 KB. Hope it works or else I have to change the stack manually.
# Fixed! With help from Valerius. Added the switch "-sg" which grows the stack.

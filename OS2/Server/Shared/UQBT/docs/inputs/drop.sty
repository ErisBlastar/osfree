%
%  This LaTeX macro is for dropping and enlarging the first letter(s) of a
%  paragraph.  The argument may be one or more letters.
%
%  Here is an example of its usage:
%
%  \documentstyle[drop]{article}
%  \begin{document}
%    \drop{IN} THE beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  Now the
%    earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the
%    deep; and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters.
%  \end{document}
%
%  Which will produce something along these lines:
%
%  I I\  I THE beginning God  created the heaven and  the earth.
%  I I \ I Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was
%  I I  \I upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hov-
%  ered over the face of the waters.
%
%  In the first instance the macro will pause during LaTeX processing and 
%  ask you for the font you wish to use for you drop capital.  When you
%  have something that looks good, then comment out box one in DROP.STY,
%  and comment in box two, replacing "cmr10 scaled \magstep5" with the font
%  of your choice.
%
%  In my opinion (DW) there are no fonts available in the standard
%  TeX/LaTeX set that are ideal for this use, unless you go down to 9pt or 
%  8pt for your text face, and this is too small.  If you have Metafont you
%  should consider generating a cmr17 font at a magstep of two (about 25pt)
%  or three (about 30pt), or even more, depending on the point size of your
%  main text.  Why not go the whole hog and design some really fancy 
%  capitals from scratch!

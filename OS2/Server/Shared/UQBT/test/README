This directory holds the test-related executables and files needed to test
uqbt. Most executables were built using gcc, and the optimization level used is
usually given in the file's name (e.g., sparc/fibo-O4). Where not given, assume
gcc and -O4. Some executables are assembled (using the gcc compiler driver)
from assembly (.s) files; the example code has been taken from a variety of
compilers, including pascal compilers; the example code was chosen to test some
specific feature (e.g. switch statement with no subtract for the lower bound).

We have the executables under CVS control since many can not be
recompiled without access to a machine with a different architecture;
also some details of the executable vary from compiler to compiler.

To run the tests, cd to the <workspace>/test directory and type (for
example):
		
	tclsh regression.test pentium sparc

Or cd to the <workspace> directory, and type

    tclsh test/regression.test sparc jvm

The -match command can be used to run specific tests; see "man tcltest" for
details. Example:

    tclsh test/regression.test sparc sparc -match "switch.*"

# Caller epilogues.
###################

    # Standard epilogue (may not be present) is to remove n bytes from the
    # stack. This is usually done with "addql #nn, %a7", (or addqw, same
    # semantics) or with an "lea nn(a7), a7" instruction.
    # Gcc likes to use addaw
    # Note: we don't use a pattern for addq any more, since that way we bypass
    # the decoder, and hence the "0 really means 8" semantics.
    # The analysis code doesn't really need these epilogues anyway
    CALLER_EPILOGUE clear_stack n IS
        [
#         addql     (n, alADirect($SP)) |
#         addqw     (n, alADirect($SP)) |

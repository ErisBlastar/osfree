setboot is a Linux and DOS utility for OS/2 Boot Manager users.  It reboots
to a specified OS or partition.  It's useless if you don't use Boot Manager.

	   OS/2				Linux or DOS

	SETBOOT /IBD:C			setboot c:
	SETBOOT /IBA:DOS		setboot dos

Other SETBOOT options are not supported by setboot -- it just selects
the system to load at the next boot and that's it.


=== Building ==============================

    1. edit the script "setboot" to use the rebooting method of
       your choice -- reboot(1) or shutdown(1), whatever flags you like

    2. make install BINDIR=/usr/local/bin  (e.g.)


=== Using ==============================

'setboot' 	with no args lists the boot manager menu.
		DO THIS FIRST TO SEE IF IT CAN READ YOUR SETUP CORRECTLY

'setboot X:' 	reboots from OS/2 drive letter X.  Case is ignored.

'setboot xxxx'	reboots from menu choice xxxx.  Case is ignored,
		and unique abbrevs are ok.


=== Installing under DOS ==============================

    C>copy setboot.exe d:\bin      (e.g.)


=== Using under DOS ==============================

  C>setboot	with no args lists the boot manager menu
		DO THIS FIRST TO SEE IF IT CAN READ YOUR SETUP CORRECTLY

  C>setboot linux     	(or whatever, see above)
  C>CTRL+ALT+DEL

The following 4dos alias will run setboot and then reboot the machine:

  c>alias setboot d:\bin\setboot %& && reboot

setboot.exe can reboot the machine itself.  If you use this feature,
>>NOTE<< that disk caches must be flushed or file corruption will occur.
setboot.exe does a disk reset (INT 21/AH=0D) which, by convention, tells
disk caches to sync.  It has NOT been widely tested, and probably not
all disk caches work this way.  Be very cautious if you use this feature.

But to get to the point, the syntax is

  C>setboot /b linux

To be prudent, use this in a .BAT that first flushes the disk cache:

  MEGACACHE /FLUSH
  SETBOOT /B %1


=== Footnote: on floppy boots ==============================

Your BIOS setup screen may contain an option like 'Boot Sequence C:,A:'.

This option is very nice -- if you use it you will never accidentally
boot from a forgotten floppy, which might contain a malicious boot
sector.

However, it is a bit of a pain when you actually do want to boot off a
floppy.  Boot Manager is no help.  LILO is.

To make it easy to boot from floppies, add something like this to
/etc/lilo/config:

    other = /dev/fd0H1440
      label = A:
      loader = /etc/lilo/chain.b
      unsafe
    other = /dev/fd1h1200
      label = B:
      loader = /etc/lilo/any_b.b
      unsafe

Use whatever /dev/fdxynnnn names are appropriate for your hardware.
If you don't have any_b.b lying around, just omit the B: entry, or
if you really want it, the LILO source Makefile will build any_b.b.

Then to boot from a floppy, select Linux from the Boot Manager menu,
hold down Shift to get a boot: prompt, and type A:.

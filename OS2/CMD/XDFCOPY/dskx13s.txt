       Short Description: Source code for dskxtrct version 1.3
        Long Description: DSKXTRCT is a program for unpacking diskette images
                         produced by SAVEDSKF such as those distributed by
                         IBM for fixpacks.  Courtesy of the author, this
                         archive contains the source code.  The makefiles
                         are for compilation with IBM Visual Age C++
                         version 3.65.

                         DSKXTRCT extracts the original files from DSK
                         files into a subdirectory, avoiding the need
                         to recreate diskettes. This is useful if the
                         desire is to copy the original files onto a hard
                         drive without creating intermediate diskettes.
                         One of the major purposes for DSKXTRCT is to
                         create a hard drive subdirectory directly from
                         IBM fixpak DSK files that can be used to apply
                         the fixpak, bypassing the creation of diskettes.

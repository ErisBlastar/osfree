DSKXTRCT and DSKCOMPR - Version 1.2 - 4 Jul 1998
Copyright 1997, 1998 by Alan B. Arnett

- combine DSKXTRCT and DSKCOMPR into one program.

- allow selection of extract and compare (immediately afterwards)
in the same invocation.

- allow an initial checksum pass of all input files, continuing
to extract and/or compare only if all files pass checksum
verification.

- add support for parameters to be input from a parameter file.

- build a GUI front end for program invocation.

- implement any needed Y2K support in handling file dates.

- add message id numbers to all messages and create in index of
messages in the documentation to fully explain the meaning of
each message.

- add internal logic control to better control program
termination under non-critical conditions and add options to
control the sensitivity of program termination to different error
levels.

- improve DSK file detection logic to allow skipping of non-DSK
files found by source file mask.

- add a /fixpak parameter to automate the handling of duplicate
"CSF_DISK" files and possibly override some of the defaults for
this specific condition.

- add file selection by name or mask of files to be extracted
from the DSK file.

- add to the 'replace/skip' file prompts the option to specify a
different file name or location.

- report skipped and/or replaced files separately from other FILE
level messages.

- add the option to make the default log file location the target
directory rather than the current directory. This can be done now
by specifying a fully qualified log file name.

- add the option to suppress creation of subdirectories defined
in the DSK file so all files are extracted into the target
directory.

- add support for compressed DSK files.

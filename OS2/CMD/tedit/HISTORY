Version 3.1 13-Aug-02

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fix bug with QUERY ECOLOUR on Win32 platform.
     o Entering a shifted character in response to FILLBOX command
       on X11 port resulted in incorrect values being inserted.
     o Fixed compilation errors on platforms that don't have KEY_MOUSE
       in curses.h
     o Fixed compile error on AIX when using REXX/6000.
     o Fixed bug with SET MARGINS; second parameter did not allow '*'
       to be specified.
     o Fixed bug with ZONE command when only the first parameter was
       supplied.
     o Fixed small bug with identification of magic numbers in new
       files when the first line was copied into the file.
     o Changed limit on number of files that can be edited from 256 to
       2,147,483,647
     o Fixed bug with sorting a file with only 1 line.
     o When two different files are displayed as a result of SCREEN
       command, and COPY BLOCK (box block) is performed, block in
       source window does not get reset. Now fixed.
     o Changed HTML TLD comment terminator from "-->" to ">"
     o Fixed bug introduced in 3.0; QUERY and EXTRACT would not recognise
       abbreviated keywords. eg. QUERY ARB would fail and you needed to use
       QUERY ARBCHAR.
     o When editing a symbolic link, unless BACKUP INPLACE is ON, the
       symbolic link was lost. This is now fixed.
     o Display of pending prefix indicator in STATAREA now clear.
     o Added workaround for bug in AIX curses, where the cursor would
       move down one line when typing text into the last displayed column and
       the screen autoscrolled.
     o Fix for column position being calculated as a negative value on
       some platforms, resulting in scrolling to the left beyond column 1.
     o X11 port of THE more stable on startup (with PDCurses 2.5)
     o Fix bug with changing file name, path or extension when run in
       batch mode.
     o Fix bug with resizing of THE window to a small number of columns;
       still potential crashes if the window is resized to < 10 columns.
     o Functions: focuseof() and focustof() returned the wrong value when on the
       command line and the curos was last on a line other that 'top-of-file'
       or 'bottom-of-file'.
     o Fix error with wrong command being repeated (with REPEAT) command in
       a macro.
     o Minor changes to deregister dynamic functions like parser.1() so that
       Object Rexx 2.2 on Linux does not leak shared memory and cause THE to
       crash.
     o Fix bug with syntax highlighting for LABELS.
     o Comments delimiters defined in TLD files can now be specified as 
       case-insensitive.
     o Fixed bug with GET CLIP: under Win32.  Now doesn't crash after
       multiple uses of GET CLIP:
     o Use of ALT keyword on :function definitions in a TLD file did not
       work.
     o Remove limit on 20 directories in MACROPATH; now no effective limit.
     o Fixed Rexx/Trans DLL on Win32 platforms that caused THE to not work
       with Object Rexx on Win2K and XP.
     o Allow CMATCH command to be executed from a batch command.
     o Disallow CURSOR HOME from a batch command.
     o Allow C-C, C-S and similar commands in OS/2 port (fix to PDCurses)
     o Fix bug with SET TRAILING and empty file.
     o Allow more flexible specification of hex and decimal strings in targets.
       /   x'3e2d' /  is now identified as a valid hex string target (with
       HEX ON of course). Bug #531800
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o Any ECOLOUR character can be used in the 'alternate' colour specifier
       for 'keywords' in a TLD definition. Previously, only the 'alternate'
       characters 1 through 9 were allowed.
     o Added optional targets on EXTRACT PENDING command.
     o Color on X11 port now behaves differently with PDCurses 2.5 and
       above.  "Bold" colors are now drawn in the same font, but in a
       brighter color.  This means that any monospaced font can be used;
       there is no need to have an equivalent bold font.
     o "Blink" color "modifiers" on X11 port now displays background in
       bright color.
     o Added extra color "modifier"; italic on X11 port. To display text in
       italics, you must have a normal font and italic font of the same size.
     o Cursor on X11 port can now be set to blink with PDCurses 2.5 and
       above. 
     o The "find" family of commands can now be run without the mandatory
       string parameter.  Like LOCATE, these commands can use the string
       used in the last "find" command if no parameter specified.
     o [SET] COLOUR and [SET] ECOLOUR have options to turn on or off display
       modifiers like BOLD, BLINK etc.  These can be set for individual
       colour specifications or for all colour specifications.
     o Profile files specified with the -p command line switch will use
       the same mechanism for locating the file as is done with the THE
       MACRO command. ie THE_MACRO_PATH=/usr/local/THE set and mymacro.the
       is in /usr/local/THE; the -p mymacro will find
       /usr/local/THE/mymacro.the
     o When setting variables via EXTRACT with Regina, THE now uses direct
       setting rather than symbolic setting of variables. Should be no user
       effect.
     o POPUP command now returns POPUP.2 which contains the item number selected
       or 0 if nothing selected and POPUP.3 which is the item number of the line
       last highlighted.
     o POPUP command now has no effective limit on what can be poped up. If the
       number of lines or columns is too large for the size of the screen,
       scrolling is now enabled.
     o SET FULLFNAME now switches between displaying the fully qualified filename
       of the current file and the FNAME omponent of the file.
     o Rewrote build.the macro to use POPUP command and to not stay in the macro
       after the build is executed.
     o Number of lines in SET MSGLINE can be specified as * to indicate as
       many lines as will fit on the screen. The number of lines argument
       is now validated against the screen size and starting line argument.
       A new CLEAR argument is also provided to clear the msgline contents.
     o Slight change with syntax highlighting; brackets are not coloured
       if there is no MATCH heading in the associated TLD file or if
       SET HEADER MATCH OFF is set.
     o New optional specification for coloring functions not specified
       explicitely.
     o Minor changes to syntax highlighting of numbers.
     o SCHANGE now executes the previous arguments when no arguments are
       specified.
 --- New features:
     o Support for GNU Regular Expressions in LOCATE and ALL commands. Command
       syntax is LOCATE Regexp /RE/ and ALL Regexp /RE/ respectively.
     o Added new SET REGEXP command to allow specification of which Regular
       Expression syntax that is to be used in targets.
     o Added new Appendix (7) for explaining some details of Regular Expressions.
     o New command line option; "1" for X11 port. This runs THE in
       "single window mode". What this means is that every time THE 
       is started, it checks to see if THE is already in "single window
       mode" for the curent user, with the same optional filename supplied.
       If so, the file or files requested to be edited on the command line are 
       sent to the running instance and are added to that instances ring.
       Values from command line of -l, -c and -r passed to server and applied
       to the file being edited.
       Works on Unix with XCurses and ncurses.
     o Added SYNONYM command. Not a full implementation yet; doesn't
       support parameter reordering.
     o Add support for Rexx/Trans on Unix and OS/2 platforms.
     o Added new command SET EQUIVCHAR to set a character to be used
       in parameters that would normally take '=' to specify a value
       from the current file or view. Default value is '='.
     o All SET commands can now use EQUIVCHAR where appropriate.
     o Any command parameter that specifies a filename can use the
       EQUIVCHAR to specify portions of the filename.
     o Ports of THE now available for Amiga, BeOS, AtheOS, Linux/390
       and Mac OSX.
     o Added QUERY/EXTRACT NBSCOPE; number of lines in scope.
     o Added EXTRACT FIELDWORD to return the current word in the current
       field.
     o Added new command, REDIT, to discard the changes to the current
       file and reload it back into the ring retaining the current
       location.
     o Added BOUNDMARK, a new SET command, and associated QUERY/EXTRACT
       and COLOR setting.  BOUNDMARK displays vertical lines between
       characters indicating columnar areas like ZONE or TABS.  Only
       significant on X11 port of THE with PDCurses 2.5 or above.
     o Implementation of :number, :column and :postcompare headers
       in a TLD file.
     o Added initial COBOL, MAKE and OPL TLD files in the distribution.
     o New command; SET HEADER, to turn on or off portions of the
       current syntax highlighting.
     o Added optional Common User Access (CUA) commands to allow
       THE to behave in a manner consistent with the CUA definition.
       New commands; SOS CUADELBACK, SOS CUADELCHAR.
       Changed commands; CURSOR now has a CUA option for UP, DOWN, LEFT,
       and RIGHT. enter command now has optional CUA option.
       MARK command also has a CUA option to mark a CUA block, which is
       like a STREAM block, but acts like the CUA mark.
       See the sample cua.the macro for setting up THE to work like a CUA
       editor.
     o Added new config.the macro. It is a GUI configuration tool for THE
       but is incomplete at this stage. This requires Rexx/Tk 1.2 or above
       to work.
     o Added new sample macro; tags.the. This is intended to be used with
       Exuberant Ctags.
     o Added new sample macro; nl.tld. This displays a POPUP with all the
       named lines in the file and moves the cursor to the selected line.
     o Added new sample macro; complete.the. This macro provides code
       completion for Rexx and C languages. Should be easy to extend it
       for other languages.
     o Added new colour setting capabilities; CPREFIX and CGAP. These are
       equivalent to PREFIX and GAP respectively, but relate to the current
       line.
     o Added THIGHLIGHT support; RESET, SET/MOD/QUERY/EXTRACT THIGHLIGHT, and
       [SET] COLOUR THIGHLIGHT.
       THIGHLIGHT displays found string or RE targets in the colour specified
       by [SET] COLOUR THIGHLIGHT.  Also string targets in SCHANGE command
       also displayed in thighlight colour.
     o Added [SET] TRAILING to change behaviour of trailing blanks in
       files. 
     o Added preliminary compatibility mode for ISPF.
       Changes include SET COMPAT, display of "TABS>", "COLS>" in prefix
       area for tabs and cols indicator lines.
       The changes are incomplete.
     o Added new command; CURSOR GOTO. This is similar to CURSOR FILE, but
       will move the cursor the the specified line/column even if they are
       not in view.
     o Added new SET command; TARGETSAVE. This allows you to specify which target 
       types are saved for subsequent calls to the LOCATE command without any
       parameters. By default; SET TARGETTYPE ALL, the LOCATE command without any 
       parameters, locates the last target irrespective of the type of target. 
       This is the current behaviour.  With SET TARGETTYPE STRING then
       the only target saved will be one that has a string target component.
       ie. if you executed LOCATE /fred/ then LOCATE :3 then LOCATE, the final
       LOCATE will look for /fred/ NOT :3
     o Added new SET command; PAGEWRAP. This allows the user to specify if
       FORWARD and BACKWARD commands wrap to the bottom and top of files
       automatically or not.
     o Added new SOS command; SOS CURSORSHIFT. Similar to SOS CURSORADJ but
       shifts text to the right of the cursor to the cursor position.
     o Added QUERY/EXTRACT EFILEID to return the original filename of the current
       file.
     o Added QUERY/EXTRACT LASTOP to return the last operand specified for
       various commands.
     o Added SET FILETABS, TABFILE command and SET COLOUR/COLOR FILETABS and
       FILETABSDIV. FILETABS allows for a single-line window displayed at the
       top of the screen containing the filenames of all files (except the
       current file) in the ring. Clicking the mouse on a filename makes it the
       current file.
     o Added new prefix commands for all compatibility modes:
         +---------------
         LC - lowercase line(s)
         UC - uppercase line(s)
         LCC - lowercase block
         UCC - uppercase block
         ( - shift left column(s) within zone
         ) - shift left column(s) within zone
         (( - shift left column block within zone
         )) - shift left column block within zone
         Not implemented yet...
         O - overlay line(s) - same as OVERLAYBOX (except ISPF mode)
         OO - overlay block(s) - same as OVERLAYBOX (except ISPF mode)
         +---------------
     o Added or modified prefix commands for ISPF compatibility mode:
         +---------------
         A - after target
         B - before target
         R - repeat line(s)
         RR - repeat block
         O - overlay line(s) - (ISPF behaviour)
         OO - overlay block(s) - (ISPF behaviour)
         COLS - column indicator line
         TABS - tabs indicator line
         BOUNDS - bounds indicator line
         +---------------

Version 3.0 16-Jan-00

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fix bug with QUERY RING; not all files were displayed depending
       on MSGLINE setting.
     o Implied extract functions for RING now work for all files in the
       ring. Thus if you have 20 files in the ring ring.20() will return
       the details about the 20th file in the ring.  If you close one
       file ring.20() will result in an error.
     o Fixed some formatting errors in the generated HTML documentation.
     o Allow 'C' as mouse button action (click) in DEFINE command. eg
       DEFINE CLB in FILEAREA... (click left button). Not all curses
       libraries support this.
     o Fixed bug in COPY BLOCK of line block from one file to another.
       Sometimes after the copy, any CHANGE command with BLOCK as target
       would fail.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o [SET] MACROPATH can now take the string PATH as an option. This
       sets the search path for macro files to be the system PATH as
       specified in the PATH environment variable.
     o When using PDCurses and ncurses, the colours "grey"/"gray" and
       "white" have been swapped.  Thus white is now brighter than grey.
     o Remove restriction on the use of '/' as the only delimiter
       character for EXTRACT command.
     o Fixed bug in locating a string when SET WRAP ON and the focus line
       has had changes made to it.
 --- New features:
     o Syntax highlighting!
       Added support for syntax highlighting, modeled on KEDIT for Windows
       syntax highlighting.  Commands added: [SET] COLOURING/COLORING,
       [SET] AUTOCOLOUR/AUTOCOLOR, [SET] PARSER, [SET] ECOLOUR/ECOLOR.
       New appendix in documentation to explain how syntax highlighting 
       works and the format of language definition files.
       Also added AUTOCOLOR, AUTOCOLOUR, COLORING, COLOURING, ECOLOR, 
       ECOLOUR, and PARSER to QUERY/EXTRACT commands.
     o Added [SET] CTLCHAR and support in [SET] RESERVED to allow reserved
       lines to be displayed in different colours.
     o Added new command line switch; -q, to suppress the message that is
       displayed when error messages are displayed from execution of the
       profile file.
     o Started a FAQ.
     o Added the following valid key names; SHIFT-L, SHIFT-R, CONTROL-L,
       CONTROL-R, ALT-L, ALT-R.  These correspond to pressing the
       equivalent modifier keys by themselves.  The CONTROL-R should be
       useful for XEDIT users!  Note that not all platforms support the
       return of key events when pressing the modifier keys by themselves.
       Also be careful with assigning commands to the modifier keys and
       then using the modifier keys to modify other keys; as some
       curses implementations will ALWAYS return a modifier key event 
       followed by the "normal", modified key press.
     o Added [SET] LINEFLAG command to change the characteristics of a
       line.
     o Added POPUP, DIALOG and ALERT commands.
     o Added extra [SET] COLOR options for ALERT and DIALOG commands.
     o When used with PDCurses 2.4 (non-beta version), the X11 port of THE
       has a new switch command line; -X. This allows the specification of 
       both standard X11 switches, such as "-iconic", "-display" as well as
       XCurses-specific switches such as "-colorBlack" which correspond to
       the XCurses resources that can be set via .Xdefaults file.
     o Added optional specification of soft label key format.
     o Added SET COMPAT KEDITW (Kedit for Windows) and default colours.

Version 2.8 31-Jul-99

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed a bug with THE functions returning a value > 255 characters.
     o THE incorrectly executed the profile file against a file edited
       from within the profile file.
     o EXTRACT /GETENV would always return an invalid value.
     o If the current directory were changed from within the edit session,
       the new directory was not being used when determining the path when
       editing a file.
     o EDITV LIST now shows full variable name.
     o THE now registers its external functions in both upper and lower case.
       This is done to cater for Rexx interpreters that are sensitive about
       case with external functions; noteably REXX/imc (Patch by Ian Collier)
     o Files edited on AFS mounted file systems under HP-UX should now work.
     o Fixed bug with SPLIT and JOIN commands when run from the command line;
       the current line was advanced incorrectly.
     o Fixed bug with "ls ~"; now returns correct directory listing.
     o SOS DELLINE will now save the line being changed before it deletes
       it. This is done so that if you happen to be typing the line and
       delete it before moving off the line, RECOVER will get it back
       correctly.
     o The first() boolean function was defined incorrectly.  It was
       essentially defined to be the same as leftedge().  It now correctly
       reports 0 if on the left edge of the FILEAREA, but VERSHIFT is
       > 0.
     o CURSOR CMDLINE col; now positions the cursor at the specified
       column correctly, when the command is run from the command line or
       from a macro run from the command line.
     o STREAM blocks support added for COPY and MOVE. Still to do: PUT.
     o When autosaving files as a result of a trapped signal, turn off the
       signal handler, and only save files that have outstanding changes.
     o DEL -* when the current line is more than half way down the file
       used to leave one line undeleted which should have been deleted.
     o COPY -* to a target now works correctly.
     o Don't execute the profile file against a file when that file is 
       already in the ring.
     o Fixed bug with allowing pseudo files to be saved.
     o Fixed the error that indicates that line 0 is longer than the maximum
       line length. Now correctly indicates line 1.
     o Fixed crash when MOVE BLOCK is execute when there is no marked block.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o Added new default mouse button behaviour; 
       DEFINE A-PLB in FILEAREA BACKWARD
       DEFINE A-PRB in FILEAREA FORWARD
     o OSREDIR now returns the error from the command executed.
     o READV KEY now recognises mouse events.
     o HIT also now recognises mouse key definitions.
     o The last target value used by the LOCATE command without any
       parameters, is not changed by LOCATE commands run from within
       a macro.
     o PUT command now valid in readonly mode.
     o In XEDIT compatibility mode, reserved lines are not copied to a file
       when that file is brought into the ring.
     o Lines with a pending prefix command are now not displayed as a
       result the ALL command unless the line contents match the target in
       the ALL command.
     o Allow XX,X and S prefix commands in readonly file.
 --- New features:
     o Added a new SET command; READONLY. This has the same effect as the
       -r command line switch, but only affects those files that were
       read into THE as readonly files. Option FORCE forces ANY file to be
       readonly.
     o Added SET TOFEOF command, to turn on or off the display of the
       top-of-file and bottom-of-file lines.
     o Added new macro; build.the. This is a more sophisticated attempt
       at an IDE in THE than compile.the.  See also setbuild.the.
     o The pseudo-file CLIP: can be used in place of the filename 
       argument in the PUT and GET commands.  This functionality
       available on OS/2, Win32 and X11 ports of THE with version
       2.4 and above of PDCurses. "CLIP:" is the system clipboard or
       equivalent (selection under X11).
     o Added INPLACE option to SET BACKUP. This option preserves all
       system file attributes of the edited file. The original file is
       emptied BEFORE the new contents are written. Thus there is a chance
       that you will lose your file, but the file retains all of its original
       attributes.
     o Added mouse support for ncurses-based ports of THE. Note that
       ncurses does not support mouse movement, so dragging the mouse
       to mark a line or box block does not work.
     o Ports of THE using ncurses now resize correctly if the terminal
       resizes  and issues a SIGWINCH interrupt.  QNX pterm works fine, 
       but xterm and nxterm need an extra keystroke to refresh the screen
       correctly. (Only tested with ncurses 4.2). (I believe this is
       a "feature" of ncurses).
     o Added TAG command to highlight all lines that contain a target.
       Similar to ALL, but all lines are displayed and tagged lines are
       shown in a different colour.
     o Added optional line/column specifiers to MARK command allowing the
       user to explicitly specify the dimensions of a marked block.
     o Added new QUERY option; REXX to return version details of Rexx
       interpreter being used by THE.  Output is identical to Rexx command
       PARSE VERSION.
     o THE now works on QNX.


Version 2.7 27-Dec-98

 --- Bug fixes:
     o On some systems, THE would crash after the first several 
       keystrokes.
     o On some systems, blank lines would match every string target.
     o Printing blank lines sometimes produce junk.
     o Version information on WinNT was incorrect, as was some 
       documentation files.
     o Use of OSREDIR command in profile file when suspended on Unix
       would cause THE to stop.
     o Compilation errors with non-ANSI compilers fixed.
     o Included extra HTML documentation courtesy of Franz-Josef Wirtz.
     o Re-released 16bit Windows THEdit shareware package.

Version 2.6 14-Nov-98

 --- Bug fixes:
     o The screen would not be refreshed as a result of issuing Rexx
       commands via THE's REXX command. It now does.
     o The implied extract functions; colour.n() (not the color.n()
       functions) were failing.
     o SLK display line was not being refreshed when it was overwritten.
     o SLK OFF was unsupported despite the documentation saying it was.
     o EXTRACT FMODE would return "1" instead of the drive letter.
     o The first row of the message line was not being cleared after 
       a QUERY command on some platforms.
     o THE would not compile on AIX 4.2 with "standard" curses, due 
       to some changes in IBM's curses code.
     o Under some Unix platforms, THE would crash on exit when an
       error or warning message was displayed.
     o Return code from SET ETMODE ON|OFF with no following parameters
       now returns correct value; 0.
     o Column commands such as CINSERT, CAPPEND would leave a nul
       character, 0x00 at the end of the line.
     o The fix in 2.5.2 for editing a file from the DIR.DIR file, 
       when the file is a symbolic link, didn't work when the symbolic
       link was an absolute path.
     o Fixed MARK STREAM command. STREAM blocks now supported for
       following commands: LOWER, UPPER, FILLBOX, DELETE, CHANGE.
       Still to do, COPY and MOVE.
     o inblock() function now works for STREAM blocks.
     o SOS TABWORDB and SOS TABWORDF now respect SET WORD ALPHANUM.
     o Printing under OS/2 should now work.
     o THE now configures correctly on HP-UX 11.0.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o When UNTAA is ON, the default value for certain commands like
       DELETE, REPEAT etc. is 1.  This resulted in unexpected and
       undesirable behaviour.  Commands that have an explicit default
       of 1, now have an explicit default of +1, to overcome the UNTAA
       behaviour. Thanks to Arthur Poole for pointing this out.
     o A small performance increase should be expected for
       Rexx commands assigned to function keys, using the DEFINE key
       REXX commands...
       In previous versions, THE would pass the source specified as an
       "instore" macro and ignore the returned, tokenised code.  THE
       now saves the tokenised code and passes this to the Rexx
       interpreter.  The first time the key is pressed may in fact be
       slightly slower, but subsequent executions should be faster.
       How much of a performance increase you get depends on how
       efficient your Rexx interpreter's parsing abilities are.
     o Extended curses support now only allowed for AIX 3.x.  As AIX 4.1
       and above now has System V curses, this is the prefered curses
       library for the character mode version of THE.
     o The Rexx indicator of the STATUSAREA, which used to be a space
       or 'R' to indicate if Rexx support was enabled has been changed
       slightly.  When Rexx support is enabled, instead of 'R' being
       displayed, one of the following characters is displayed to 
       indicate which Rexx interpreter support THE was compiled with.
       Values are:
         +---------------
         R - Regina
         O - Object or OS/2 Rexx
         Q - Quercus Personal Rexx
         W - Enterprise WinRexx
         I - Rexx/imc
         U - uni-REXX
         6 - REXX/6000
         T - Rexx/Trans (Rexx Translation package)
         +---------------
     o FILLBOX now allowed for LINE BLOCKS.
     o What constitues a word with the MARK WORD and DELETE WORD
       commands has now changed.  It now matches the SOS TABWORDF
       definition of a word.
     o READV now sets 4 Rexx variables, the new fourth value is the
       shift status associated with the key being pressed.
     o A new optional parameter has been added to the MACRO command.
       Specifying this; a '?', enables Rexx macros to be interactively
       traced with TRACE ? in the macro file.  In previous versions,
       this was the default for MACRO, but it involved a significant
       processing overhead.  Now, Rexx command files assigned to keys
       should execute quicker.
 --- New features:
     o Added new SET command; CLEARERRORKEY. This enables you to
       specify which particular key clears the message line. Default
       behaviour is that any key pressed will clear the message line.
       Also added CLEARERRORKEY to query/extract/modify.
     o Added query/extract/modify for DIRINCLUDE.
     o Added new SET command; TIMECHECK. This enables you to
       specify if THE checks the timestamp of a file when you SAVE or
       FILE it.  If TIMECHECK is ON and the modification time of the
       file has changed, THE will not save the file.  You can force the
       save of the file with SSAVE or FFILE.
       Also added TIMECHECK to query/extract/modify.
     o The PRINT command in Win32 now can specify fonts, font size,
       paper orientation etc.
     o New command line options; -l and -c.  These specify the starting
       current line and column respectively for all files edited from
       the OS command line.
     o A new SET command has been included; STATOPT.  This controls
       what internal variables are displayed on the status line. Any
       value that can be obtained via the implied extract functionality
       can be displayed.  eg the default options displayed are NBFILE.1
       and WIDTH.1.
     o Added new boolean functions ALT, ALTKEY, CTRL and SHIFT.
     o Added EXTRACT LASTKEY
     o Added KEDIT command.
     o THE now allows stdin as a profile file.  When specifying
       the profile file on the OS command line with -p, the filename
       is '-'.  Thus; the -p - file_to_edit takes macro commands from
       stdin.  This feature is only allowed when the -b (run in batch)
       switch is also specified!!
       This feature is useful for porting XEDIT/REXX programs like:
         +---------------
         /* CMS */
         queue 'top'
         queue 'c/this/that/ all'
         queue 'file'
         'X THIS FILE A'
         +---------------

       The equivalent for THE with Regina is:
         +---------------
         /* THE/Regina */
         queue 'top'
         queue 'c/this/that/ all'
         queue 'file'
         'LIFO> the -b -p - this.file'
         +---------------

Version 2.5.2 31-Jul-98

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed problem with unaligned access problems on 64bit machines.
     o Also fixed a few compiler warnings.
     o Editing a file from the DIR.DIR file, when the file is a symbolic
       link, now correctly edits the file pointed to by the symbolic
       link.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o STATUS command now displays in 6 columns.  On 25 row screens some
       status information was likely to be lost.

Version 2.5.1 28-Jul-98

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed problem with compiling without Rexx support.
     o Fixed the Win32 port mouse support.  Mouse support would only
       work until a Rexx macro or an operating system command was 
       called and then mouse support would be disabled.
     o Fixed bug in COMPAT XEDIT mode where the behaviour of the
       "enter" command in the FILEAREA would behave like INPUT command
       rather than SOS ADDLINE/LINEADD.
     o Fixed bug in display of cursor when in insert mode under 
       several platforms.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o SOS ADDLINE/LINEADD under COMPAT XEDIT now works more like
       XEDIT.


Version 2.5 30-Jun-98

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed problem with DIR or THE/XEDIT/EDIT command in a profile. 
       THE would go into an infinite loop.
     o LSCREEN values were not available as implied extract functions.
     o Specifying 0 for row or column with CURSOR SCREEN/ESCREEN now 
       causes an error.
     o lastmsg.1 not being set when MSGMODE is OFF
     o fixed bug with SET AUTOSAVE in profile
     o fixed cursor positioning bug when an "edit" command was issued
       for a file already in the ring from a macro or key
     o fixed error with alteration counts not being reset when saving
       a file under AFS.
     o ALL command on a file with no lines caused THE to crash
     o return codes from THE macros called by other macros should now
       be returned
     o EXTRACT /INBLOCK/ now correct for all marked blocks (except STREAM)
     o CINSERT will now insert spaces.
     o implied extract functions, such as alt.1(), will fail if called when
       no files are in the ring.
     o EXTRACT RESERVED did not include attribute modifiers when run on
       mono monitor.
     o Fixed error with ACLs under HPUX where if the file system did
       not support ACLs, files could not be saved.
     o Fixed error in PRESERVE/RESTORE where changes to the layout of
       the displayed screen were not being restored.
     o Made changes to support API changes in Regina 0.08c.
     o SET COMPAT would reset ALT settings.
     o A command consisting of blanks returns an error; now simply
       ignored.
     o With STAY OFF, PUT now moves the current line to the target 
       line if in COMPAT XEDIT(feel) mode.
     o EXTRACT /CURSOR with cursor in prefix area, now returns the
       file's line number in cursor.3.
     o THE can now handle messages via MSG and EMSG commands > 160 
       characters.
     o Fixed problem with dir() boolean function to return correct
       value.
     o EXTRACT /RING in COMPAT XEDIT(feel) now returns the number of
       files in the ring in ring.1. For COMPAT THE and KEDIT the number
       of files is returned in in ring.0.
     o With HEX ON, LOCATE /x'00' would match every line in the file.
     o When an attempt to edit a file with a line width > the current
       WIDTH setting, THE would not close the file. On some platforms
       this meant that file was no longer accessible until the edit
       session was ended.
     o Under Unix, THE now attempts to preserve the file's user and 
       group ownership ids. This should work fine for the file's
       owner and for root, but probably won't for other users.
     o Use of interactive trace in a THE macro would not work under
       OS/2, DOS or WIN32. Should now.
     o Commands that are very long, particularly those issued from 
       macros used to crash THE. Now they shouldn't.
     o Fixed behaviour of CMATCH in COMPAT XEDIT mode.
     o Fixed bug in COMPRESS command.
     o Corrected SOS DELLINE and SOS ADDLINE behaviour when issued on
       cmdline.
     o In COMPAT XEDIT, SET TABSIN caused the current line to be moved
       to the bottom of the file.
     o THE now compiles on Digital Unix 4.0
     o In COMPAT XEDIT mode, THE would allow characters from the prefix
       area to display in the gap between the prefix area and the filearea.
     o THE now removes multiple, consecutive slashes from a filename.
       eg. /usr///include//stdio.h is now interpreted as 
           /usr/include/stdio.h
     o Fixed typo in INSTALL file --with--curseslibdir changed to
       --with-curseslibdir
     o Fixed an error with EXTRACT. If a space appears before the first
       item name to extract, an error was displayed and the last item
       was not extracted.
     o Use of UPPER or LOWER commands did not set the LINEFLAG to
       changed.
     o An invalid hexidecimal or decimal value in a string target now
       only results in one error message, rather than one per line of
       the file.
     o The OS family of commands now return the return code from the
       operating system command.
     o The definitions and behaviour of CURSOR SCREEN/ESCREEN row col
       were reversed.
     o Fixed cursor positioning problems with SOS DELLINE when the
       *** Bottom of File *** line was the current line.
     o Any commands that saved a file with a different name to the
       file being edited; eg PUT, SAVE and FILE, always kept the same
       attributes as the original.  This has been changed so that any
       new file takes on default attributes (and ownerships) as would
       a new file.
     o Several documentation corrections, particularly in the HTML
       source. Thanks to Franz-Josef Wirtz for reporting these.
     o Fixed error with SET COLOR. The NONDISP colour would always get
       changed.
     o Fixed a problem with unknown keys, such as decimal 226 (A-B),
       using ncurses.  These now can be assigned commands with DEFINE
       (eg. DEFINE \226 TOP) and will display their correct assignment
       when using SHOWKEY.
     o Trailing spaces on the command line will now be passed to macros.
     o Fixed a bug on some System V R4 curses and ncurses, where the 
       cursor would disappear after toggling the INSERTMODE to ON.  This
       was caused by a lack of the terminal's capability to display the
       cursor in a high visibility mode, instead it would not display
       it at all.
 --- New features:
     o Added new SET commands; FILENAME, FNAME, FEXT, FTYPE, FMODE 
       and FPATH.
     o Added COLOR option to EXTRACT and QUERY commands.
     o Added WIDTH display to status area.
     o Added [SET] SLK to allow user to define soft label keys.
     o Added SLK to [SET] COLOR.
     o Added new command line option; -k to enable soft label keys
       support.
     o HTML'd the HISTORY file.
     o Added [SET] WRAP
     o Added [SET] WORD
     o Added [SET] WIDTH
       This enables the maximum width of a line to be set within an
       edit session.
     o Added [SET] FULLFNAME to specify if the file's fully-qualified
       filename is displayed on the IDLINE or the name of the file
       as entered by the user is displayed.  This command may change to
       include settings for whether the file's fully-qualified name is
       used when writing the file.
     o On Unix platforms, if THE suffers a core dump, THE will attempt 
       to autosave all files that are currently open. (Thanks to Ian
       Collier for this good suggestion)
     o Added a new SET command; UNTAA. This is an ancronym for 
       "Unsigned Numerical Targets Are Absolute". This SET command
       affects ALL numerical targets, not just the LOCATE command!
     o Added SET COLOR/COLOUR GAP to enable the colour of the gap
       between the prefix area and the filearea to be specified. By
       default, COMPAT XEDIT will display the gap in the same colour
       as the filearea, COMPAT THE in the same colour as the prefix
       area.
     o Added [SET] DEFSORT command to specify how files should be
       sorted in the DIR.DIR file. Also added DEFSORT as a valid
       option for EXTRACT.
     o Added EDITV command for setting and retrieving persistent macro
       variables.
     o Added SET SPAN, SPILL and TRUNC.  They don't do anything yet.
     o Added REXX command to allow Rexx instructions to be run from
       the command line.
     o Included the Regina memory management routines into THE to
       increase its performance.
     o Added SOS PASTECMDLINE SETTAB INSTAB STARTBLOCK and ENDBLOCK.
     o Added EXTRACT FIELD.
     o Added shadow() boolean function to determine if the cursor is
       on a shadow line.
     o Under Win95/NT, THE can now use Object Rexx, Personal Rexx,
       Enterprise Rexx and uni-REXX interpreters in addition to the 
       default interpreter, Regina.
     o Added support for uni-REXX 2.7.0 under Unix.
     o Added QUERY and EXTRACT COLOUR (alternate spelling for COLOR)
     o Added [SET] UNDOING to enable the saving of changed lines to
       be avoided. This makes large changes or deletes slightly quicker
       at the expense of not being able to RECOVER those lines affected
       while UNDOING ON is in effect.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o EXTRACT RESERVED format has now changed. Originally the format 
       of the returned string was:
         +---------------
         line-number foreground background modifier text...
         eg. -1 red white normal This is a reserved line
         +---------------
       The new format of the returned string is:
         line-number modifier [modifier[...]] foreground on background text...
         +---------------
         eg. -1 red on white This is a reserved line
             -2 bold reverse white on black This is a reserved line
         +---------------
       This new format now ensures that the contents of the reserved line
       can be extracted from the returned value. The following example
       is guaranteed to work on colour or mono displays.
         +---------------
         Parse Var reserved.1 . 'on' . text
         +---------------
     o Added FULL as optional parameter to LEFT and RIGHT commands.
     o Changed the behaviour of cursor movement in COMPAT XEDIT to be
       more consistent.
     o Slight change in the way THE determines the name of a macro to
       execute.  Assuming the value of MACROEXT is "the" and you have
       a macro called fred.the in the current directory, then the
       following commands are equivalent:
         +---------------
         ====> macro fred
         ====> macro fred.the
         ====> fred          /* assumes IMPMACRO is ON */
         ====> fred.the      /* assumes IMPMACRO is ON */
         +---------------
       In previous versions, THE would always append the MACROEXT, so
       macro fred.the would attempt to find the file fred.the.the.
     o There is now only one help file; called THE_Help.txt rather
       than one for each platform/terminal type.  THE_Help.txt replaces
       the *.hlp files.  The only difference between these files was the
       default key definitions.  These are now in the one table.
     o Changed the comm.the and uncomm.the sample programs to support
       HTML comments.
     o Changed the match.the sample program to support LaTex begin/end
       pairs.
     o Added [Column|CURSOR] options to SPLIT and JOIN commands.
     o Inserting of lines greater than WIDTH setting, either via INPUT
       or JOIN are now truncated, and the message "Truncated" displayed.
     o Blank lines are now saved for use with RECOVER command.
     o With the addition of the SET FNAME, FILENAME etc commands, it
       was necessary to change the value returned for EXTRACT /FNAME.
       Prior to this release, EXTRACT /FNAME returned the full filename
       of the current file.  EXTRACT /FNAME in this release, returns
       the filename portion of the full file name; excluding the file's
       extension.  To achieve the same functionality as before, use
       EXTRACT /FILENAME.
     o Added a new make target; help. This builds the THE_Help.txt
       from the source code.
     o QUERY command now ignores the current setting of MSGLINE and
       displays all lines without scrolling, provided they all fit
       on the screen!
     o SET POINT did not allow numeric values. Now SET POINT .12
       works as expected.
     o Removed extraneaous screen displays in CANCEL, CCANCEL and 
       SOS EDIT commands.
     o File dates displayed in a DIR.DIR listing now have 4 digits.
       The result of this is that file names now start in column 38
       instead of 36.  If you have any macros that rely on this
       position, they will need to be changed.
     o In previous versions, the setting of SET MSGMODE for a new view
       of a file would be obtained from the setting of the view from
       which the file was edited.  Thus if MSGMODE was OFF in the current
       file, and another file was edited, then the value of MSGMODE for
       this file would also be OFF.  This has now changed so that the
       the default setting of MSGMODE will be ON irrespective of the
       setting of MSGMODE in the current file.  Obviously, if SET
       MSGMODE OFF is in your profile and SET REPROFILE is ON, then
       the new file will have a MSGMODE of OFF.
     o Fiddled around with the colours GREY (and GRAY) and WHITE to
       try to get WHITE not be BOLD WHITE and GREY to be BOLD BLACK.
     o Added OFF option to SET TABS to turn off all tab settings.
     o The COMPAT command has changed slightly when the third parameter
       is not supplied (function key compatibility).  Previously, if the
       parameter was not supplied, the default key mapping for the
       current compatibility mode would reset, removing any customised
       key definitions.  The behaviour now is to leave any key
       definitions intact.

Version 2.4 01-Feb-97

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed problem with key defined as SOS DOPREFIX EXECUTE
       and supplied l.the prefix macro.
     o SPLIT command issued with cursor after the end of line
       now does not core dump.
     o SOS EDIT on blank line now no longer core dumps.
     o Fixed bug with "the -h" on OS/2.
     o Fixed major problems with PRINT command; it ignored
       effect of SET SELECT. Also corrected printing of marked
       blocks to only print the contents of the block.  ZONE
       settings are also noew respected for the PRINT command.
     o Fixed various documentation bugs principally in EXTRACT
       section.
     o SORT command did not respect SCOPE; now does.
     o SHIFT command now respects a marked block.
     o Fixed some problems with cursor positioning in prefix area when
       the prefix area includes a gap; as in COMPAT XEDIT.
 --- New features:
     o First release of port for DOS with VCPI.  This executable
       also runs as an OS/2 program.

Version 2.3 17-Dec-96

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed syntax error with [SET] ARBCHAR, now allows specification
       of ON or OFF without optional arbchar characters.
     o Fixed cursor positioning errors with DUPLICATE and COPY BLOCK
       when new focus line would not be in currently displayed lines.
     o Fixed multiple key definitions for the "DEL" key. Now each
       different key that could represent a "delete" key is called a
       different name; DEL, REMOVE, DC.
     o Disable [SET] AUTOSAVE on psuedo files.
     o Change commands with a parameter of '*' for number of occurrences
       to change, will use the file's line width to determine the maximum
       number of changes to make rather than 2147483001. The use of the
       rather large number made it appear that THE was stuck in an infinite 
       loop.
     o Fixed bug with HEX string targets.
     o Fixed bug with segmentation fault caused by:
         +---------------
         ====> the file.one
         ====> statusline off
         ====> the file.two
         +---------------
       This fix also fixes the error where if you have set STATUSLINE OFF
       and then run SET COMPAT, which turns STATUSLINE ON.
     o Fixed "feature" with exit codes from Unix commands called from
       the run_os() function.  All exit codes were multiples of 512.
     o Fixed bug with CDELETE command, positioning cursor incorrectly
       on line after deleting characters.
     o Fixed bug with CAPPEND, CREPLACE and CINSERT which did not allow
       for leading or trailing spaces in text argument.
     o Fixed bug with default file types displayed in DIR.DIR file. The
       documentation for [SET] DIRINCLUDE states that the default is
       *; ALL file types, but the actual default setting was NORMAL,
       ARCHIVE and DIRECTORY files.  This caused me an hour of debugging
       when I couldn't see any files on a CD :-(
     o Fixed bug with all SET commands that use the M (middle) position
       specifier. Commands like CURLINE, SCALE, TABLE etc. would core
       dump under Unix.
     o Fixed minor bug with error messages displayed for invalid file 
       name and/or file path.
     o Fixed a problem with PUT command. If PUT was issued while in a 
       read-only directory, the temporary file could not be created.
       The temporary file now is created in a known, writable directory.
     o A bug with CLOCATE and an absolute target.  If the cursor was
       located in the filearea and to the right of the current column
       position, the new current column position as specified by the 
       absolute target would not be changed.
     o Fixed a long-standing bug with block prefix commands.  When one
       block prefix command is entered, and another prefix command (not
       the other end of the block prefix command), the block prefix
       command executes as though the other end of the block prefix
       command was entered.
     o Fixed bug with [SET] CMDLINE OFF when run from profile file.
     o Fixed bug with ETMODE default settings when running with XCurses.
     o Fixed error message that is displayed when READV CMDLINE is called
       with no command line.
     o Fixed implied extract functions; position.2() amd position.3().
       They now produce the correct results.
     o Fixed core dump when using GET command and file contains lines
       greater than maximum width.
     o Worked around bug in ncurses;  the cursor would disappear when
       in insert mode.
     o Fixed cosmetic bug when marking a block in one view with an
       existing marked block in the other view in split screen mode.
     o Fixed bug with X and XX prefix commands when current line was
       to be excluded.
--- New commands:
     o Added PREVWINDOW command; complement of NEXTWINDOW; to move to
       the previous file in the ring.
     o Added [SET] ALT command to allow the alteration counts to be
       changed.
     o Added REPEAT command.
     o Added [SET] MOUSE command and new options to QUERY, EXTRACT
       and MODIFY commands.
     o Added [SET] HIGHLIGHT command and new options to QUERY,
       EXTRACT and MODIFY commands.
     o Added PRESERVE and RESTORE commands.
     o Added SET MACRO command.
     o Added COMPRESS command.
 --- New features:
     o Multiple arbchar character matches now work in targets.
       Thanks to Regis Bossut for implementing this!
       ARBCHAR support in the CHANGE command still to be done :-(
     o In mouse-supported ports, Right Button Press on the IDLINE will
       execute PREVWINDOW command.
       Also, double-clicking the Left Mouse Button on a file in the
       DIR.DIR file, will execute SOS EDIT.
     o In memory REXX macros now supported with optional [REXX] keyword
       in DEFINE command.  In REXX supported ports, you can now do something
       like:
         +---------------
         ====> define f1 rexx if after() then 'sos firstcol'; else 'sos endchar';
         +---------------
       This will then do the same as the SOS STARTENDCHAR command.
     o Added Win32 platform support. THE now runs as a native, console
       application under Win95 and WinNT.  The mouse is supported as are
       long file names.
     o Added ability to reassign mouse events via the DEFINE command.
     o Selectable highlighting of lines now available.  It is possible
       to display selected lines in a diferent colour. See [SET] COLOUR
       for new HIGHLIGHT and CHIGHLIGHT options.
     o Changed the file display in DIR.DIR under Unix platforms to show
       symbolic links as 'ls -l' shows them.
     o Added support for changing the default behaviour of THE 
       where the behaviour of XEDIT and KEDIT differ. eg. COVERLAY
       command.
     o Added support for ACLs under AIX.
     o High-order characters in the Latin-1 character set can now be entered
       with a "compose" key under XCurses port.
     o THE error messages are written to the pseudo REXXOUTPUT file immediately
       after the command that caused the error.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o When multiple files are in the ring and you exit from one of these,
       the file in the ring PRIOR to the file exitted will become the new
       current file.  The previous behaviour was to make the NEXT file in
       the ring the current file.  The new behaviour is more intuitive,
       particularly when editing files from the DIR.DIR file and there are
       other files in the ring.
     o QUERY RING has changed to report files in the ring beginning with the
       current file rather than the first file edited.
     o Commands that can result in multiple lines being changed, like
       CHANGE, LOWER, UPPER, etc. will now update the alteration count
       once per command rather than once per line that has changed.
     o Added support for the System V compiler under SunOS. If /usr/5bin
       is in the PATH before running configure THE, and you do not have
       gcc or acc, then the System V compiler (and curses) will be used.
     o Allowed greater range of punctuation characters to be used as string
       target delimiters.
     o Altered parsing of command line to allow for commands and arguments to
       abut one another.  This allows for 'next 5' to be specified as 'n5'
       and also more obscure command syntax like 'upper$fred'; equivalent to
       existing 'upper /fred'.  The downside of this is that macros which begin
       with a valid THE command abbreviation, and follow with a delimiter will
       be treated as a THE command, NOT as an implicit macro. eg. Suppose you
       have a macro called upp.fred, you have IMPMACRO ON, and you attempt to
       call that macro from the command line implicitly with ====> upp.fred, THE
       will attempt to execute the UPPER command with a target of the named line;
       .fred rather than your macro.
     o Added support for multiple ?s in ? (retrieve) command.  eg. specifying ??? 
       will now return the third last command entered on the command line.
     o The SOS ENDCHAR and SOS STARTENDCHAR commands now work while in the
       prefix area.
     o CHANGE command, when the target is a BOX BLOCK, will now change
       strings within the column bounds of the BOX, rather than all
       occurrences on the line.
     o DEFINE command now has option to assign functionality to mouse
       events.  The syntax for this includes a specification of which
       THE window the mouse event is to be executed in.  See the
       default mouse event assignations for valid window names.  These
       names are a subset of the valid areas that can be changed colour
       with the [SET] COLOUR command.
     o SHOW command now displays mouse event assignations.
     o Added new subcommand to CURSOR; MOUSE.  This command moves the
       text cursor to the last position that a mouse event occured.
       This command is intended for use when redefining mouse events.
     o Added HIGHLIGHT and CHIGHLIGHT options to [SET] COLOUR command.
     o Added LINEFLAG and INPUTMODE options to QUERY, EXTRACT and STATUS.
     o Changed the behaviour of the ENTER key while in the FILEAREA.
       Originally, when INSERTMODE was ON, the ENTER key would add a
       blank line, and when INSERTMODE was OFF, the ENTER key would
       simply move down a line.  The behaviour now is determined by the
       setting of INPUTMODE.  With INPUTMODE OFF, the cursor always moves 
       down a line.  With INPUTMODE LINE, the default,  a new line is 
       always added when the ENTER key is pressed.
       INSERTMODE FULL, which is intended to be be similar to XEDIT
       power input mode has not been implemented yet.
     o The CHANGE command can now be run with no parameters, to re-execute
       the last change done.
     o Added extra, optional parameters to [SET] COMPAT command.  The first
       new parameter allows the user to change the feel of THE to mimic
       the default behaviour of XEDIT, KEDIT or THE.  The second new parameter
       determines the default function key binding to be used, again
       compatible with THE, XEDIT or KEDIT.
       The first parameter of the [SET] COMPAT command determines how THE 
       will look; the second how THE will feel, and the third the default
       function key bindings.
     o Added extra parameters to [SET] PREFIX command to allow the user to
       specify the width of the prefix area and any gap between the prefix
       area and the filearea.
     o With the addition of more punctuation characters as valid target
       delimiters (including the underscore character '_'), the CONTROL_CHAR
       command has been renamed to CONTROLCHAR.
     o Several values returned by EXTRACT now respect XEDIT compatibility
       when in COMPAT = XEDIT. They are:
         CURLINE, LINE, LINEFLAG, POINT, SELECT
     o OVERLAYBOX now supports line blocks.
     o The A and I prefix commands now move the cursor to the file area.

Version 2.2 26-May-96

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed a small memory leak when quiting from a file.
     o Some colours were not behaving consistantly.  This was corrected.
       eg REVERSE is now BLACK on WHITE, NOT reverse of the current
       colour. WHITE is now a bright white. The original WHITE is
       now GREY or GRAY.
     o Fixed bug with SOS TABWORDB. When the first word in the line
       started in column 2, the cursor would go to column 1.
     o Fixed bug with 'EXTRACT /POINT */'. This, or any parameter with
       arguments, would only work if it was the last parameter in the
       list of parameters to EXTRACT.
     o Fixed small bug with MACROPATH.
     o Fixed [SET] RESERVED to respect spaces after the last attribute
       specifier. Now it is possible to have spaces preceding the reserved
       text.
     o under OS/2 (and probably DOS), when a DISK FULL error occured when
       writing a file, the file could not be closed and therefore could not
       be removed while returning the file to its original state.
     o box commands COPY BLOCK and MOVE BLOCK now respect scope.
     o Fixed bug with trailing spaces on command line. (Introduced in 2.1)
     o Fixed bug under HP-UX with ACLs on NFS mounted disks. Files can now
       be saved, but any ACLs are lost on the original files.
     o If CURLINE M was in effect, and MOD CURLINE was issued, the response
       would be SET CURLINE M+0. M+0 is an invalid specification.
     o SET SCREEN now adjusts CURLINE setting when screen size changes.
     o MODIFY command would always append a space after the SET command
       returned.
     o Fixed problem with setting RESERVED, SCALE, TABL or HEXSHOW lines
       the same as CURLINE. You get an error if the position is the same
       as CURLINE.  Similarly it is an error to set CURLINE to a position
       which is already occupied by one RESERVED, SCALE, TABL or HEXSHOW.
     o Fixed bug with SET PREFIX OFF when issued from CMDLINE or from PREFIX
       area.
     o Fixed bug with macros calling other macros. If an EXTRACT was issued
       from within one macro after calling another macro, the command would 
       be rejected.
     o Fixed bug with REXX macro containing REXX SAY command with no
       arguments and REXX output captured to a file; a line of junk would be
       inserted into the REXXOUTPUT file.
     o Changed output of Q TABS to respond to INCR n if tabs were set with
       INCR option.
     o Fixed problem with TABS output from 'STATUS file' to not truncate the
       tabs string.
     o Fixed bug with contents of cmdline.3 after EXTRACT /CMDLINE/.
     o Fixed bug with end() and blank() not returning correct values in
       certain circumstances.
     o The retrieve last command command; ? retrieved the wrong command. 
     o Fixed core dump when attempting to edit a file in a directory
       that doesn't exist from the OS command line. eg
         +---------------
         % the xyx/abc
         +---------------
       where the path xyz does not exist
     o Fixed core dump when issuing SET SCREEN with no operands.
     o Fixed up CURSOR ESCREEN when issued in split screen mode. It
       wouldn't move to the correct place.
     o On some platforms, a core dump would occur when trying to edit a
       file with lines longer than the maximum line length.
     o Fixed bug with negative offset paragraph indents.
     o Fixed bug with CURSOR FILE when display had been scrolled 
       horizontally.
     o Editing with split screens is more stable.
     o PUT now respects SET STAY
     o REDRAW command now redraws screen correctly.
     o Fixed problems with moving WORD and COLUMN blocks.
     o Fixed a bug that showed up in SET COMPAT where the redefinition
       of the ENTER key would cause a core dump.
     o Fixed minor bug in parsing various [SET] commands.  More than
       one space before a parameter would invalidate the parameter.
 --- New commands:
     o Added [SET] CURSORSTAY to set the behaviour of the cursor when
       scrolling the file with FORWARD or BACKWARD.  Originally, with
       the cursor in the filearea, when a FORWARD or BACKWARD command
       was executed, the cursor would move to the current line (unless
       SET COMPAT XEDIT/KEDIT was in effect.  The default behaviour is
       now to leave the cursor on the same screen line when the file
       scrolls (CURSORSTAY ON). This command allows for the original
       behaviour; with COMPAT THE, to be selected.
     o Added new EXTRACT option; SHOWKEY.  This option allows the macro
       writer to extract the commands assigned to a key after having run
       a READV KEY command.
     o Added a new sample macro; spell.the. This provides spell checking
       capabilities in THE.  This macro requires International Ispell
       Version 3.1 or above and REXX support.
     o Added a new sample macro; demo.the. This macro is a self-running
       demonstration of THE concepts and commands. It requires REXX
       support.  Run it via: the -p demo.the demo.txt
     o Added FIND, FINDUP, FUP, NFIND, NFINDUP and NFUP commands.
     o Added CLOCATE and CDELETE commands, but with no string targets.
     o Added COLUMN option to QUERY and EXTRACT commands.
     o Added BLOCK option to QUERY (already in EXTRACT) command.
 --- New features:
     o This release is the first to run as a native X11 application.
       Features unique to the X11 version include; resizing of the X 
       window by dragging the window border and mouse support, including 
       cursor positioning, marking blocks etc.
     o The method of reading files from the command line and processing
       the profile file has changed dramatically.  This was done to
       enable the processing of all commands from the profile file. As
       a result, a new comand line switch; -b, is required to execute
       a profile file against a file (or files) in batch mode.  This is
       particularly necessary when run as a cron job under Unix.
     o Added new external function; run_os().  This function enables
       macro writers the ability to run an OS command with stdin coming
       from a REXX "array", and stdout and stderr going to a REXX "array".
     o Added [SET] XTERMINAL to specify which program to run when an
       OS, DOS or ! command is executed without arguments.
     o The source distribution has been reconfigured with GNU autoconf.
       This should make configuring on different Unix platforms
       simpler.
     o Added APPENDIX 2 to explain how THE handles the keyboard.
     o Added APPENDIX 3 to document the default mouse behaviour.
     o Added -u display_length command line switch to allow THE to be 
       used as a non-line mode editor.
     o A HTML version of THE reference manual can be generated from the
       source code.  Run "make html" to build the HTML reference files.
       Start at index.htm.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o The name of the key associated with the curses KEY_RETURN
       has been changed from "ENTER" to "RETURN".
     o Rationalised the naming standard for function keys.  This
       could break existing profile key definitions. Check APPENDIX 2
       for details.
     o Added the optional argument; ALL to SHOWkey. This will
       create a new "pseudo" file showing all key default key
       definitions followed by any redefined keys.  The format
       of the display is suitable for using as a macro to set all
       key defintions to the state they were in when the 
       SHOWkey ALL command was issued.
     o Default for MSGLINE is now ON 2 5 OVERLAY.
     o Added * OFF option to [SET] RESERVED
     o Added * option to 'EXTRACT /RESERVED */'
     o Added TYPEAHEAD to output from STATUS, and allowed it as a valid
       QUERY and MODIFY option.
     o Added CMDLINE option to READV command.
     o Default setting for CURLINE in THE compatibility now M; same as for
       XEDIT and KEDIT compatibility modes.
     o Added SCREEN to QUERY, MODIFY, and EXTRACT.
     o Removed source files: extcurs.c, bsd.c
     o When displaying 2 views of the one file, both views are updated
       simultaneously.
     o Added RING option to QUERY and EXTRACT commands.
     o Some default key definitions have changed; notably the default
       assignments for F6, F11, and F12 to be consistent across platforms
       and because '?' command now works :-)
     o The CONTROL_CHAR and FILLBOX commands, will now leave the cursor
       positioned in the file rather than at the end of the message line.
     o Changed the format of colour specifiers; THE now supports the
       optional "on" between foreground and background colours.
       eg: red on blue, is now allowed, as well as: red blue
     o In XEDIT compatibility mode, it is now possible to move the cursor
       onto the *** Top of File *** and *** Bottom of File *** lines. This
       was done to enable the cursor to be moved with the mouse when the
       mouse is pressed above or below the file limits.
     o The output from SHOWKEY ALL, now has commands enclosed in double
       quotes (") instead of single quotes ('). This was done to allow
       for key definitions that contain hex strings.
     o Added NONE option to [SET] EOLOUT
     o Expanded [SET] ETMODE ON to allow for specifying exactly which
       characters are to be displayed as themselves. This will be
       beneficial to non-english language users.
     o Cleaned up the documentation and enabled generation of an HTML
       version of the THE manual.
     o Allowed CMATCH command to be executed from command line, and
       more importantly, from within a macro.
     o Added optional command to be executed after LOCATE command.
     o Changed the key mapping significantly to provide the most
       logical key mapping for commonest keyboards; those with 12
       function keys. See Appendix 2 for key mappings.
     o SPLIT, SPLTJOIN and JOIN commands now work from the command
       line and act from the current focus column.
     o More performance improvements have been made;
       LOCATEing a string with a trailing space is up to 7 times faster
       CHANGEing lines in a large file is also significantly faster.

Version 2.1 24-Jun-95

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Bug fixed with ALL followed by DEL *
     o Could not find a named line if the named line was the
       "Bottom of File" marker.
     o Fixed cursor positioning errors if [SET] SCALE, TABLINE or
       RESERVED were executed while in filearea and the cursor was
       on the line where the scale, tab or reserved line is to be
       displayed.
     o copying lines from one file (with SELECT 1 - from ALL) copies
       lines NOT selected. SCOPE ALL also ignored in copy.
     o PUT and PUTD did not copy the correct number of lines after ALL
       command
     o QUERY TABKEY and SET TABKEY were not consistant. QUERY TABKEY
       returns settings as per SET TABKEY.
     o OVERLAYBOX now respects SCOPE
     o Fixed a core dump bug with implied extract under OSF/1.
     o Scale line was not displaying past the end of ZONE.
     o SOS DELWORD now positions the cursor correctly
     o bug with 'c /x   //' on some systems fixed.
     o DUPLICATE, when assigned to a key, caused cursor to move
       strangely
     o LEFT and RIGHT commands allowed in read-only mode.
 --- New commands:
     o Added OSREDIR command.
     o Added a new sample macro; compile.the. This is a macro that
       will compile the current C program, and enable the stepping
       through, backwards and forwards, each error message, making
       each line associated with an error the focus line. Normal
       editing is still possible, although slower.
     o Added CAPPEND,CFIRST,CINSERT,CLAST,COVERLAY,CREPLACE commands.
     o Added COLUMN option to CURSOR command.
     o Added LSCREEN option to EXTRACT command.
 --- New features:
     o HP-UX version will preserve Access Control Lists (acls) on files
       if the file is saved with the same name. The directory list
       (DIR.DIR) also indicates if a file has acls associated with it
       by displaying a '+' at the end of the file permission string.
     o The OS/2 version preserves Extended Attributes on files if the
       file is saved with the same name.
     o the 'pseudo' files DIR.DIR and REXX.$$$ are now REALLY pseudo
       files. No actual file is created as a result of the DIR/LS
       commands or from REXX output. Also the filename details
       displayed on the idline reflect the contents of the file.
     o THE can now read Apple Macintosh text files.
     o Although not strictly a new feature in this release, it should be
       mentioned that THE will work with both REXX/imc and REXX/6000 on
       each platform that each of these interpreters is available.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o SOS MAKECURR now correctly does nothing if executed from the
       command line
     o Added another option to [SET] EOLOUT; CR, to write out files
       compatible with the Apple Macintosh.
     o Several performance improvements have been made:
       Reading and writing of files is now up to 3 times quicker.
       Operations towards the end of files with many lines is now
         quicker.
     o GET command now has the options, FROMLINE and NUMLINES to read
       a portion of a file.
     o Default width reduced from 2048 to 512
     o all commands should now allow trailing spaces on the command
       line
     o Using BSD curses now incurs a penalty; the bottom line of the
       screen is not used. This is because BSD curses automatically
       scrolls the screen when a character is displayed in the bottom
       right corner. Now that THE can be configured to have different
       portions of the editor displaying on the bottom line, it was
       easier to reduce the number of lines rather than try to cater
       for all combinations of configurations.
     o [SET] TAB can now use specific tab columns as well as INCR and
       QUERY TAB, and STATUS now display the actual tab columns in
       effect.

Version 2.0P1 11-Feb-95

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed cursor positioning error when screen was scrolled to the
       left using CURSOR LEFT and SET VERIFY n m (where n > 1) was
       in effect.
     o Changed MSG and CMSG so they work from within the profile file.
     o Refresh the screen before accepting keystroke in READV.
     o Allow minimum abbreviation for BOTTOM command to be B.
     o Allow minimum abbreviation for [SET] SCALE command to be SCAL.
     o Fixed problems when using COMPAT command in a profile.
     o Fixed some problems with prefix macros.
     o Fixed Extended Curses port so that a screen of other than 80x24
       is now possible.
 --- New commands:
     o Added HIT command.
     o Added FILE option to CURSOR command.
     o Added a new sample macro; l.the. This is a prefix macro that
       can be used as a template for other prefix macros.
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o Profile processing. Under Unix, THE now executes a "global"
       profile file from $THE_HOME_DIR and then the "local" profile
       file in $HOME.
     o The order of Line, Col, Size on the IDLINE has changed in XEDIT
       compatibility mode to Size, Line, Col.

Version 2.0 26-Jan-95

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed cursor positioning error when screen was an odd number of
       columns wide.
     o Fixed problem with previous file's contents and command line
       remaining displayed when editting another file. (Only reported
       under AIX).
     o Changed code again to handle multiple commands on the command
       line AND to ignore commands issued when no files are in the
       ring (excluding any 'edit' commands).
     o Fixed DEFINE to not clear a key defintion until the validation
       of the new command(s) was complete.
     o Fixed problem with core dumps when a command was passed to the
       operating system from within a profile file.
     o Fixed bug in CURLINE when specfying a negative position. (Due to
       changing unsigned char to char)
     o Fixed bug in displaying extended characters in ETMODE.
     o Fixed bug in executing prefix commands after a TABPRE command.
     o Fixed bug in SHIFT LEFT when the length of the line being
       shifted was < first column of ZONE.
     o Text entered into the main window is displayed with the correct
       attributes.
     o Fixed bug in entering prefix commands when in the last column
       of the prefix area; the cursor would wrap to the next line; now
       it stays in the last column of the prefix area.
     o extracting values using an item abbreviation would result in
       the REXX macro being set to the abbreviation rather than the
       full name of the item. The full name of the extracted item is
       now used.
     o fixed a bug when moving a box block.
     o SPLIT, JOIN, and SPLTJOIN did not account for any pending
       prefix commands or marked block.
     o Changed all references to keyboard return values from short to
       int. This is for support of DEC OSF/1 platform.
     o The use of hex strings as an argument to the TEXT command
       defined to a key, caused problems. ie DEFINE F1 TEXT X'84'
       was altered after the first use of F1 key.
 --- New commands:
     o Added [SET] DISPLAY, SELECT, SHADOW, SCOPE.
     o Added ALL command.
     o Added CURSOR command.
     o Added LEFT, RIGHT and RGTLEFT commands.
     o Added CURSOR option to EXTRACT command.
     o Added TABL,SCALE,X,XX,S prefix commands.
     o Added [SET] RESERved , [SET] SCALE and [SET] TABLine commands.
     o Added [SET] COMPAT command, to attempt to mimic the default
       behaviour of XEDIT and KEDIT.
     o Added extra SOS commands:
       LEFTEDGE,RIGHTEDGE,PREFIX,QCMND,TABFIELDF,TABFIELDB,
       FIRSTCHAR,FIRSTCOL,LASTCOL,BOTTOMEDGE,TOPEDGE,CURRENT,
       MARGINL,MARGINR,PARINDENT,TABB.
     o Added new macros, rm.the to delete from disk the file on
       the focus line of the DIR.DIR file, and words.the to count
       the number of words to a target.
     o Added COLUMN and WORD options to MARK command.
     o added READV to enable a REXX macro to obtain keystrokes from THE.
     o added [SET] TYPEAHEAD, [SET] HEXSHOW commands
     o added [SET] STATUSLINE, [SET] MSGLINE, [SET] IDLINE commands
     o added [SET] POSITION command
 --- Changed commands or behaviour:
     o Default command for Alt-M/Ctrl-V is now MOVE BLOCK RESET not
       MOVE BLOCK.
     o FORward 0 now makes the "Top of File" line the current line.
     o BACkward 0 now makes the last line of the file the current line.
     o When the "Bottom of File" line is the current line, FORward
       will make the "Top of File" line the current line. Similarly
       for BACkward when on "Top of File".
     o [SET] CMDline OFF option added.
     o [SET] ARBchar now supports multiple character matches
     o In previous versions of THE, any line in a macro file, or
       profile file, that began with '/*' was treated as a comment
       line and the line ignored. For implementations of THE without
       REXX support, execution of a REXX macro caused mayhem. To
       overcome this situation, any macro file that is used with THE
       without REXX support must have as its first line the following
       comment string starting in column 1:
         +---------------
         /*NOREXX*/
         +---------------
       All other comments throughout the file can be valid REXX
       comments (ie. start and end with /* */)
     o A new boolean function incommand() has been added which
       has the same functionality of the previous command(). The
       boolean command() function now returns 1 if the command
       line is on.
     o Reinstated SOS EXECUTE command.
     o the valid_target() external function now returns two values;
       the first line affected by the target and the number of
       lines affected by the target. If the target is an invalid target
       ERROR is returned. If the target is valid, but the target is
       not found, NOTFOUND is returned. Sample macros altered to use
       new features.
     o NEXT and UP commands do not support negative relative targets.
       eg. NEXT -5 , UP -* are now invalid commands. This is to be
       consistent with XEDIT and KEDIT.
     o ADD command now can be specified as just "A" and when issued
       from the command line, moves the cursor to the first blank line
       added.
     o The default behaviour of the ENTER key has changed. When the
       ENTER key is hit while in the prefix area, if there are any
       pending prefix commands, they are executed, otherwise the cursor
       is moved to the first line of the next line as it used to do.
     o [SET] TABSIN ON in the profile file will not increment the
       ALT count, nor include the changed lines in the recovery list.
     o The SOS ENDCHAR command was incorrect in that it would move the
       cursor to the start of a line if the cursor was past the end of
       the line as well as moving the cursor to the end of the line if
       it wasn't past the end of the line. The correct behaviour of
       SOS ENDCHAR is to move to the end of the focus line no matter
       where the cursor currently is.  For those of you (like me) who
       are used to the old behaviour of SOS ENDCHAR, a new SOS command;
       STARTENDCHAR has been added to THE.
     o [SET] BACKUP now has TEMP and KEEP options.
     o The FILE command behaviour has been changed. Previous versions
       would not write out a new version of the file if the alteration
       count was zero and no filename was specified. FILE now behaves
       the same as XEDIT and KEDIT.
     o Added ability to specify individual tab columns in SET TABS
       command.
 --- New features:
     o Changed the method of displaying the screen. This was done to
       cater for shadow, tab,scale and reserved lines and to increase
       performance.
     o Added "-r" command line switch to operate THE in readonly mode.
       This is a real readonly mode; it is not possible to change the
       contents of the file.
     o Repeating targets with boolean operators are now supported.
     o The targets BLANK and ~BLANK are now supported.
     o A command can now follow a target on the command line without
       requiring a linend character separating the target and command.
         +---------------
         eg. :3 del
         is a valid command. You can even enter
         3 3 3 3
         on the command line to move the current line 12 lines.
         +---------------
     o Colour settings are now stored with the file, so different files
       can have different colours.
     o Wordwrap behaves like KEDIT wordwrapping. When the right-most
       character of the line exceeds the right margin, the last word
       wraps to the next line.
     o No limit (apart from available memory) on the number of prefix
       commands that may be entered. Used to be a limit of 20.
     o Key names no longer need to be expressed in exact case. C-A and
       c-a are equivalent. Also, where appropriate, keys have the same
       name across platforms.
     o THE now can be compiled with AIX Extended Curses. This enables
       colour support when run in an aixterm window.

Version 1.5 01-Dec-93

 --- Bug fixes:
     o It is now possible to issue the commands; EDIT,THE and XEDIT
       from within a macro or profile file.
     o [SET] CASE settings now inherited by subsequent files editted.
     o [SET] CASE now does not reset settings to default if they are
       not specified; it leaves the values as they were last set.
     o default value for ZONE end is now the maximum line width not
       32766 (maximum possible line length)
     o Bug in CHANGE command.
       If specifying a trailing space to change a string at the end of
       a line to null, one too many characters were removed.
       eg. c/_N // * 1   a line ending in "abc_N" ended up ending
           in "ab"
       When changing text at the end of a line and specify more than
       one space at the end of the target, the target is never found.
       eg. c/_N  // * 1   a line ending in abc_N will not be found
       Handling of spaces after the real end of the line handled
       correctly now.
     o Fixed a bug on Unix systems where a key that returned nul would
       execute 'add 1'.
     o Changed the default handling of 'sos delback' and 'sos delchar'
       under UNIX.
       The default key sequences of these keys has been reversed. If you
       prefer to keep the old definitions, define OLD_DELCHAR_DELBACK on
       the compile line. This option will disappear in a future version
       so if you are really attached to the old behaviour, you had
       better let me know and have a good reason :-) Thanks to Andreas
       Schott for pointing this out!
     o Added SRC line to makefile for SystemVR4 block.
     o The default value for THE_HOME_DIR under Unix is /opt/THE, if
       SYSVR4 is defined when compiling or /usr/local/THE otherwise. The
       major change is the uppercasing of THE (THE's correct acronym)
     o [SET] MACROPATH now sets the correct path value.
     o Fixed bug with prefix command like 'aa'. The A command would be
       executed with a large number of lines added or you would get
       a core dump :-(
     o After bringing a suspended THE session to the foreground, THE
       correctly refreshes.
     o When shelling out, the screen attributes are returned to NORMAL,
       at least on some platforms;
     o Fixed the occasional strange behaviour of the command line having
       some of the contents of the prefix area. (It was VERY obscure!)
     o SOS DELWORD would increment ALT and not allow SOS UNDO to work.
     o C-ENTER now valid for DOS and OS/2 versions.
     o Ignore any command issued from a macro file if no more files are
       left in the ring.
     o Changed the method for splitting a path and filename under DOS and
       OS/2. Hopefully fewer problems with ending up in the wrong
       directory. This has also worked around the bug in BCOS2.
     o Reexecute command,= should now reexecute the last statement
       correctly.
     o Printing under Unix more than once now works.
     o Fixed a few bugs with PUT and GET.
 --- New commands:
     o Added TERMINAL, LASTMSG, MONITOR, POINT [*], PREFIX [SYNONYM name|*]
       PENDING, GETENV and BLOCK extract
       options.
     o Added REXX macro for summing the contents of a marked BOX block.
     o Added REXX macro for matching paired words like #ifdef/#endif.
     o Added SORT command.
     o Added [SET] LINEND command to support multiple commands on a line.
     o Added [SET] ETMODE to indicate if extended characters should be
       displayed. This is designed to handle foreign languages that use
       the ASCII characters > 127.
     o Added [SET] NONDisp to specify what character is displayed if
       extended characters are not to be displayed.
     o Added [SET] PENDing to assist with writing block prefix macros.
     o Added [SET] IMPOS/IMPcmscp to allow operating system commands
       to be executed from the command line without the need to prefix
       the command with OS or !.
     o Added COMMAND command (Just for Ian Collier ;-))
 --- Changed commands:
     o Added extra argument to [SET] CASE to determine case significance
       in SORT command.
     o The order of EXTRACT /VERSION/ and QUERY VERSION options has
       changed.
     o BOTTOM command makes the last line of the file the current line
       instead of the *** Bottom of file *** line.
     o INPUT [text] command results in the line becoming the current
       line instead of the previous line, when issued from the command
       line.
     o Overhaul of commands that add a new line to fix a few bugs.
     o STATUS now displays in 3 columns; I was starting to run out of
       space with 2 columns. The item name is also highlighted.
     o When compiled with REXX support, [SET] PREFIX now supports
       prefix synonyms.
     o PUT and PUTD now work with BLOCK as the target.
     o [SET] TABKey changed to be simpler.
     o [SET] ARBchar, TABSIn, TABSOut changed to allow their second
       parameters to be specified with the OFF option.
     o STATus command now has optional filename parameter.
     o [SET] TABS now has 'INCR' as first operand when EXTRACTing or
       Querying the value.
     o MODIFY/QUERY of CMDLINE does not contain 2nd operand. This value
       is only returned as a result of EXTRACT.
     o There is no need to supply a final '/' with the EXTract command.
 --- New features:
     o REXX support for DOS is now available. This version, supplied as
       a separate archive, contains the THE executable linked with a DOS
       port of Regina. This version contains a DOS extender, so only runs
       on 386s or above. This version was compiled with DJGPP, a DOS port
       of GNU gcc. Included is go32.exe, which is the DOS extender.
     o By default all THE macros are expected to have a file name ending
       in ".the". The value for the macro file extension can be changed
       with the [SET] MACROEXT command. This default extension is only
       applicable to macros searched for in the THE_MACRO_PATH.
     o Added defines.h to specify limits which can be safely changed in
       the source code.
     o Added ability to execute multiple commands from command line and
       to assign multiple commands to a key.
     o Now have the option to display extended ASCII codes on Unix
       platforms.
     o Prefix macros can now be executed. Thanks to Dave Rittenhouse
       (david@ecst.csuchico.edu) for adding this feature.
     o Prefix synonyms are also definable for REXX macros and standard
       prefix commands.
     o THE now compiles and runs with BCOS2.
     o Added -n command line switch to enable THE to be run without
       any profile file.
 --- Warnings:
     o There is an inconsistancy with Regina 0.05h in that the use of
       implied extract with some functions will corrupt values in THE.
       Implied extract functions that have been observed to corrupt, are
       fname.1() and fpath.1().

Version 1.4 01-Sep-93 (Not officially released)

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Changed the method for determining the filename of a backup file
       under OS/2. Originally, if drive type not = FAT, .bak was
       appended to full file name. Now only if drive type = HPFS is
       .bak appended.
     o Alteration count was being set to zero when saving a file and the
       file could not be saved.
     o Fixed a few minor bugs in DUPLICATE command.
 --- New commands:
     o Added support for semi-colon specifying an absolute line target
 --- New features:
     o Added support for ncurses under linux. ncurses still has a bug
       (I believe) that causes some characters to not be cleared.
     o emx 0.8g port now has REXX support
     o DUPLICATE 1 BLOCK assigned to Alt-D (DOS/OS2) and ControlD (UNIX)

Version 1.3 15-Aug-93

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Fixed bug with line block delete and cursor positioning.
     o number of files being editted no longer gets out of sync when
       an attempt to edit a new file is aborted (usually because line
       is too long)
     o Fixed bug in uppercase/lowercase when target was "BLOCK".
     o sos tabwordb, sos tabwordf, and sos delword now correctly go the
       start/end of the word if that word exceeds the width of the screen.
 --- New commands:
     o SOS CURSORAdj
     o SOS DELWord
     o [SET] MARgins
     o [SET] WORDWrap
     o SPlit
     o Join
 --- New features:
     o Changed the highlighting of "non-printable characters" under Unix.
     o emx 0.8g compiler support now working (excluding REXX)
     o wordwrap has been added
 --- Changes:
     o The names of environment variables and the location of default
       help and profile files has changed. See the file appendix.1 or
       Appendix 1 of the.man for details.

Version 1.2 27-Jun-93 (Not officially released)

 --- Bug fixes:
     o Previous command line contents were remaining when 'sos undo' was
       executed on command line.
     o THE core dumped when a 'DELETE' command was present in a profile file.
     o THE now displays line numbers > 32k correctly.
     o Display of long filename in window wider than 80 chars now correct.
     o [SET] CURLine now works when called from a profile file
 --- New features:
     o THE now handles either forward (/) or back (\) slashes in path
       names and converts them automatically. So you can specify d:/path
       under DOS and OS/2 or \usr\bin under Unix. All paths are displayed
       on the idline with the default OS path separator.
     o added new external function, valid_target() to simplify REXX macros
     o added new single character indicator on right end status line to
       indicate if REXX support is present.
       Meanings of indicators:
         +---------------
         First character: (colour support)
           C - curses library supports colour and so does monitor
           c - curses library supports colour but monitor doesn't
           M - curses library does not support colour
         Second character: (REXX support)
           R - THE compiled with REXX support
             - (blank) THE compiled without REXX support
         +---------------

Version 1.1 17-May-93

 --- Bug fixes:
     o A file with no end of line character on the last line, the last
       line would not be included in the file.
     o Characters that are in blocks retain their highlighting now.
     o Fixed schange under DOS and OS/2. Cursor is now positioned
       correctly.
     o Writing out a file will now produce an error if the disk is
       full and not write part of the file.
     o GET and PUT now recognise ~ in Unix version.
     o PREFIX ON now no longer requires the LEFT|RIGHT option. Defaults
       to LEFT.
     o TABPRE (to tab between main and prefix areas) now does nothing
       if PREFIX is OFF.
     o 'bleeding' through of one file to another on BSDish systems now
       fixed.
 --- New commands:
     o BOX BLOCK COPY/MOVE/DELETE/FILL/OVERLAY
     o LINE BLOCK COPY/MOVE/DELETE
     o FILLBox
     o sos_makecurr
     o [SET] DIRInclude
     o [D]OSNowait/[D]OSQuiet

     o [SET] REXXOUTput
     o [SET] CLOCK
     o [SET] HEXDISPlay
     o SOS DOPREfix

     o MACRO - execute commands from a file
     o UPPercase, LOWercase
     o SHift
     o DUPlicate
     o EXPand
     o STATus
     o Query
     o EMSG
     o SUSPend
     o REDRAW
     o MODIFY
     o TEXT
     o prefix commands: a,i,c,m,d,",<,>,/,cc,mm,dd,"",<<,>>,.xxxxx
 --- Changed commands:
     o insertmode now requires a parameter: ON|OFF|TOGGLE
     o spltjoin now correctly aligns the new line under the focus line
     o sos_* commands have been changed to separate sos commands
     o REFRESH command now consistant with XEDIT and KEDIT. Use REDRAW
       for old REFRESH functionality.
 --- New features:
     o REXX support under OS/2 and Unix(with Regina 0.05)
     o argument passing to REXX macros/profiles
     o EXTRACT
     o Capture REXX trace and Say output to a file in the ring.
 --- Commands removed (temporarily)
     o SCREEN

Version 1.0 16-Aug-92

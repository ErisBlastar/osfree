  ============
  
        I did this replacement for OS/2s MINSTALL in the year 2002. The original
         MINSTALL is really buggy, crashes on lots of issues and so forth. I needed
         around 2 weeks to get about 90% of it done, sadly it wasn't released to
         the public up until 2-3 years later. Also it wasn't even tested on many packages, so
         there were a couple of compatibility issues (and I bet there are still some
         left). I was quite frustrated, because I always told to make some testing.

        Anyway, the biggest problem in writing a replacement for MINSTALL was that
         the IBM documentation has some inaccuracies in it and also original MINSTALL
         has also some undocumented features, which I needed to find out (later that
         was).

        I made some fixes later (based on v1.00) and I don't even know if those changes
         were released to the public. I don't have time for support, so I'm releasing
         MINSTALL under LGPL. Perhaps someone out there wants to tweak some things.

        MINSTALL was concepted as being a CLI-program and an actual MINSTALL API, so
         that doing a GUI installer would have been possible. The API was never documented
         due lack of time, anyway it's not that complicated. Just look into MINSTALL.C
         and you should find it out.
         
        MINSTALL checks all scripts for formatting/logic errors and reports them in a
         hopefully useful manner. So it may also get used for testing new installation
         scripts.

        I also needed to write a GENIN.DLL-stub, because some installs use that DLL directly
         and IBM's original GENIN.DLL would install parts of the package a
         second time including icons. It's really just a stub with one extra export, so
         that MINSTALL.DLL is able to detect it.

        My MINSTALL/CLI supports the original CID functionality including support for original
         MINSTALL-created scripts and my new script format.

        There are also some tweaks for base MMOS/2 installation. Most of them are documented
         within the source, so just look into it.
         
        I'm releasing the source-code under LGPLv3, so that commercial installers may use MINSTALL.DLL
         as well. The source should be complete, I also included some helper functions in stdcode.rar.

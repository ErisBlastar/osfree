New MINSTALL Response File Format:
-----------------------------------
Example:

/* New response file type, designed by Kiewitz */

MMINSTALL = (
   SOURCE = "R:\\MMeCS\\base"
   TARGET = "C:\\MMOS2"

   MMINSTGROUP[3] = (
      ( GROUPID    = 2
        CUSTOMDATA = "CARDCOUNT=1;VALUES[1]=9"
      )
      ( GROUPID    = 77
        CUSTOMDATA = "CARDCOUNT=3;VALUES[1]=2;VALUES[2]=3;VALUES[3]=4"
      )
      ( GROUPID    = 33
        CUSTOMDATA = "CARDCOUNT=1;VALUES[1]=1,4,6"
      )
    )
 )
------------------------------------
GROUPID is the ssgroup id from control.scr
CARDCOUNT is the GENIN-cardcount, VALUES[x] is the choice numbers from CARDINFO
(1 - 1st choice, 2 - 2nd choice, etc.). The array-number specifies the
corresponding card. The VALUES[x] do not have to be in order. Card 2 values may
get specified before card 1 values. CARDCOUNT *has* to be the first entry.
Also none of those variable-names is case-sensitive, this means VaLuEs[x]=x
would work as well.

I removed "CHANGECONFIG" from this response file. It will get ignored, when being used on the old formats. 
This could do trouble, but CFGSYS.DLL is not capable of doing so and imho it's just rubbish anyway, because 
old minstall generated an "updated" config.sys in C:\MMOS2, which means the user would need to copy it 
over manually, *but* minstall specified that those "changes" would need to get copied over. Actually the file is 
an updated config.sys and afaik this feature is of no use.

Also installing multiple packages at the same time is now possible as well.
Simply specify multiple 'MMINSTALL' arrays (like the construct in the example)
and that's it.

TARGET may be "". If that's the case, MMBase-environment variable will get used
as Destination. If no MMBase-environment variable is found, installation will
fail. SOURCE and TARGET must be specified before any MMINSTGROUP[x] entries.

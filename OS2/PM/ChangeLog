  June-July 2007 Some of the changes by Viking to compile FreePM with Open Watcom.
  Created makefiles in:
  	FreePM/makefile.wat 
	FreePM/watcom.mif 
	FreePM/lib/Zlib/makefile.wat 
	FreePM/lib/JpegLib/makefile.wat 
	FreePM/lib/lpng/makefile.wat 
	FreePM/lib/GDLib/makefile.wat 
  The original makefiles for Visual Age are those without .wat extension.
  Added new files:
  	include/builtin.h - This header contains the function "int __lxchg(int volatile * a, int  b)"
						which probably might mean "lock exchange". I had to implement it on my own
						because it seems to be part of the system headers in Visual Age and I
						don't have it. It seems to work but I'm not 100% percent sure if it's 
						correct. If anyone has access to the documentation for it in Visual Age, 
						I would appreciate, please send me the documentation for it.
						
	include/bsetib.h - Declararions for  PIB, TIB2 and TIB from OWs headers.
	
	include/bseerr.h - Error declarations from Open Watcom.
	
	include/error.h - An older toolkit (16 bit v. 1.3), is the file error.h from. Downloaded from
						http://www.tavi.co.uk/os2pages/oldsoft.html
						
  Changed files:
  	include/os2_ErrCodes.h - I commented out most of the error declarations for string messages 
						because it needed the Warp Toolkit which I don't have.
						


  4 July 2007; Viking. The makefiles now works to build on OS/2 with Open Watcom 1.6.

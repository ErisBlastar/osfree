What is it?

This is a stripped-down version of GNU finger 1.37 --- the client
only, to be precise --- which is provided as  a  replacement  for
the finger.exe that comes with OS/2 IAK/tcp/ip. The latter unfor-
tunately doesn't offer the '-l' option, amongst other things.


In order to make this thing more or  less  stable,  a  number  of
things had to be taken out, such as the support for faces. In ad-
dition, I haven't included support for `long' (i.e. --lotstotype)
options,  as  I  can't  see the point in having them with a small
utility like this one.


If you compile it with the -DINFO_IS_DEFAULT switch it will start
up  in  `long  info'  mode  (not a good idea in my view, but then
again, who am I?).  If you don't like the current appearance, re-
compile it with -DERROR_HANDLER for more conventional feedback.


Under  emx/gcc  0.9c it compiles with a few warnings, which to my
mind are harmless (the usual incompatible pointer type blah,  and
a few others ...)


Also  included is the `safe_finger' utility from SATAN, which ba-
sically acts as a wrapper for finger.  This program needs to know
the  location of finger.exe (specified in sf.h). I you don't have
sed, you'll have to edit this by hand.

Rights, licences etc:

As stipulated by the originators of the sources (i.e. GPL for the
GNU stuff, no idea regarding safe_finger).

Suggestions  and bugfixes can be sent to <olafz@gold.ac.uk>, com-
plaints are best directed at your favourite airline.


To  install,  type  `configure', followed by `make', and see what
happens.

/*
 * This implementation of the REXX parse template is quite near to
 * what Cowlishaw specified in his book, but there is one very
 * important difference. Cowlishaw sees a template as patterns and
 * variables, with patterns in each end (and some of the patterns
 * and/or the variables might be empty).
 *
 * The concept here is any sequence of variables and patterns, and
 * the system is parsed into two levels and interpreted as such.
 * First there is the level of patterns, which is anchored to
 * particular locations in the string to be parsed.
 *
 * When the anchor-points are determined, the variables are filled
 * in with the parts of the string that comes between each anchor.
 * Here is an example:
 *
 *    parse value 'That is a parse string!' with a b 'is' c d 'i' e
 *
 * In this example, there are four anchors in the string, the two
 * patterns 'is' and 'i', and the two implicit anchors start-of-string
 * and end-of-string. They anchor particular locations in the string
 * to the lists of variables: (a b), (c d) and (e). At the first level
 * the anchors are found and the text between them are deternmined
 * (SOS=Start-Of-String, EOS=End-Of-String):
 *
 *                            That is a parse string!
 *    anchors            (SOS)-----is------------i---(EOS)
 *    strings in-between      <a b>  <<<<c d>>>>> <e>
 *
 * Now, we have a set of substrings, and to each substring, there is
 * possibly empty set of variable which are to receive its value from
 * the contents of that substring. Doing that, we get:
 *
 *    (a b) = 'That '        ==> a='That'   b=' '
 *    (c d) = ' a parse str' ==> c='a'      c=' parse str'
 *    (e)   = 'ng!'          ==> e='ng!'
 *
 * To some extent, one might say that there are one anchor between
 * each variable, since these match a sequence of blank characters.
 * However, these have less priority than the explicit patterns.
 *
 * This file makes available three functions:
 *
 *   doparse()      parses a single string into a single template
 *   parseargtree() parses a set of strings into a set of templates
 *   bmstrstr()     implementation of Boyer-Moore string search

    * OK, here is the 'real' search. Basically, it consists of two
    * phases: first a table (next) is built up, and then the string
    * is searched using the table to decide how far to hop if a match
    * was not found.
    *
    * Let's recount some of the theory behind Boyer-Moore search. If you
    * got a pattern, P, and string to search in, S, then the first match
    * may be S[1..len(P)]. To verify whether that is actually a match,
    * we have to iterate through all the characters, i.e. over len(P).
    *
    * If that is a match, then return the correct position, else we must
    * continue. Here comes the 'tricky' part. Suppose P is 'abcccd' and
    * that S is 'gddeebfgghhhiiijjj'. Now we check character S[len(P)]
    * and depending on its value we can determine something about the
    * possibiltiy of having a match starting somewhere in the area from
    * S[1] to S[len(P)]. Clearly, if S[len(P)] is a character not in P,
    * then no match can occur in this area. Else, determine the first,
    * of the next possible match, and move forward to check that.
    *
    *
    * First, we have to set up the table to use during the search.
    * Initially, we fill the whole table with the 'default' value, and
    * then we patch the values which should have other values in the
    * loop following the call to memset().

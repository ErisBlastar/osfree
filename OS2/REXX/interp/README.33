                          Regina 3.3
                        25 April 2004

Changes in this release (from 3.2)
----------------------------------
o Integration of Florian's Generic Call Interface (GCI) into Regina.
  Supported platforms to date are Windows, OS/2 and Linux.
o Fixed bug with TRACE F and its "conversion" into "N" on a subsequent call
  to TRACE BIF.
o Addition of Polish native language support courtesy of Bartosz Kozlowski.
o PARSE LOWER and PARSE CASELESS added.
o Major changes to EXIT handling
o Regina determines internal and external queues by the fact that external
  queues MUST have a '@' in the name. Therefore any time a queue name is
  used; in RXQUEUE or ADDRESS...WITH, then if the queue name has a '@'
  then Regina treats this as an external queue, and requires the RXSTACK
  server to be running.
o New BIF POOLID. Allows the current variable pool number to be obtained
  (effectively the level of called subroutines).
o VALUE BIF allows environment to be a number corresponding to a variable
  pool number. Therefore unEXPOSEd variables in any subroutine can be accessed.
o API functions Rexx*Dll() now implemented.
o Locale support for BIFs like TRANSLATE now supported, and can be overridden 
  from command line. (-l switch)
o Algorithm for determining where a Rexx program is (either from command line, or
  a CALL statement called.  Apart from a change in the precedence of directories
  an environment variable REGINA_SUFFIXES is used to supplement the file extensions
  that Regina uses to append to the passed file name. More details can be found in the
  Regina documentation.
o Regina OPTIONS can now be specified as an environment variable, which will set the
  default values for OPTIONS. The OPTIONS instruction can still be used and will
  override the defaults.
o A new OPTION has been added; CALLS_AS_FUNCS to allow programs that use the non-ANSI
  format of "CALL label(arg1,arg2)". Although this is implemented as an OPTION, it can
  only be set via the REGINA_OPTIONS environment variable!
o Another new OPTION; QUEUES_301 to duplicate the behaviour of Regina queues; both 
  internal and external.
o Some memory leak fixes with INTERPRET and some "handle leaks" under Windows fixed.
o Initial support for SkyOS
o Fixed some old bugs: (documented in BUGS file)

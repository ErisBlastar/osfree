# Guidelines for Translators
# --------------------------
# - Lines beginning with # are comments
# - Any word in UPPER CASE should not be translated
# - On some error message lines, there are tokens following the
#   | character. Again these should not be translated.
# - Please ensure that the order of the substitutions; ie the %s, %d
#   placemarkers are maintained. If this is gramatically impossible,
#   please let me know.
# - There are some comments at the end of this file under the heading:
#   "Extra general phrases requiring translation:"
#   Please translate these phrases also.
# - Return the translated error messages in a complete file, the same as this
#   file, with the name XX.mts where XX is the ISO language abbreviation.
#   Important: Please zip the file up to ensure that the file arrives in
#              its original form
#   Add a comment at the top of the file indicating the language, and your name and email address.
#   If you do not want your email address published in the Regina documentation
#   please indicate this. I will retain your address as a contact for future
#   individual message translations, but will only publish your name.
# - And last but by no means least; thanks!

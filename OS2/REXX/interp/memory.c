/*
 * The routines in this file try to minimize the the number of calls
 * to malloc() and free(). Since it would generally not be possible to
 * release memory, unless it actually is last in the virtual memory
 * that the process holds, just don't release it, and let the
 * interpreter grow. Memory are allocated in only certain sizes, and
 * are "freed" to a freelist, which is within the interpreter.
 *
 * The important routines are get_a_chunk() and give_a_chunk(), which
 * might be called a large number of times. All the other routines are
 * either called once to initiate, or it is used in tracing and
 * debugging, where speed and space is not important anyway.
 *
 * The algorithm works something like this: memory can only be allocated
 * in predetermined sizes (8, 12, 16, 24, 32, ...) and allocation of a
 * size other than that will have to allocate something slightly bigger.
 * For each size, there is a linked list of free pieces of memory of
 * that size, the first entry of each of these lists can be accessed
 * through 'flists', which is an array of pointers to these lists.
 *
 * Every time someone needs a piece of memory, the first piece of the
 * freelist containing memory of suitable size (as big or slightly
 * bigger) is returned. If the list is empty, a large piece of
 * memory is allocated by malloc(), chopped up and put on the freelist
 * that was empty.
 *
 * When memory is released, the prime problem is to decide which
 * freelist to put it on. To manage that, each time memory is
 * allocated by malloc(), the upper and lower address of the memory
 * is put in hashtable; given a particular address, the hashtable
 * can be sought using the address as hashvalue, and the result will
 * be the size of the memory chunks at that address.
 *
 * When dealloacting strings, we know the max-size of the string, and
 * then we can calculate which freelist the string should be put on,
 * without having to search the hashtable structure. Note that there
 * is no need to deallocate strings using the give_a_string() function,
 * the normal give_a_chunk() will work just as well, but is somewhat
 * slower.
 *
 * If you don't #define FLISTS, then malloc() and free() should be
 * used instead. That might be very slow on some machines, since rexx
 * tend to use lots of small size memory. If you #define TRACEMEM,
 * memory is traced, which also tend to be slow, since there is a lot
 * of overhead in allocation and deallocation. Also note that in the
 * current implementation you can use malloc()/free() in parallel with
 * the routines defined here.
 *
 * Note that using this metod, the last piece of memory freed will be
 * the first to be used when more memory is needed.
 *
 * The number of calls to malloc() seems to be negligable when using
 * this method (typical less than 100 for medium sized programs). But
 * this is of course dependent on how the program uses memory.
 *
 * The tracing part of this file, (#ifdef TRACEMEM) is an optional
 * extention for debugging purposes. Whenever memory is allocated,
 * mymalloc() allocates 16 bytes more than needed. These bytes are
 * used like this:
 *
 *   0       4       8      12       16 bytes
 *   | count |f|m|seq| prev  | next  | start of allocated memory
 *
 * The 'count' is the number of bytes allocated, 'f' (flag) is used in
 * garbage collection, and 'prev' and 'next' are pointers used in a
 * double linked list. seqv is a sequence number which is iterated
 * for each memoryallocation.
 *
 * count is int, prev and next are char*, f is char and seqv is a
 * 16 bit integer. The 'm' is a magic number. Actually it is just
 * there to fill the space, and can be used for more useful purposed
 * if needed.
 *
 * An additional option to TRACEMEM is filling allocated and deallocated
 * memory with bitpatterns. If the PATTERN_MEMORY cpp-variable is set,
 * all allocated memory is initated to NOT_USED, and deallocated memory
 * is set BEEN_USED before deallocation.
 *
 * Garbage-collection is not implemented, but listleaked will list out
 * every chunk of allocated memory that are not currently in use. The
 * array markptrs contains a list of functions for marking memory.
 * There is a potential problem with garbage collection, since the
 * interpreter might 'loose' some memory everytime it hits a syntax
 * error, like "say random(.5)". To fix that, memory should either
 * be traced and then garbage collected, or it should have a sort
 * of transaction oriented memory management (yuk!).
 *
 * NOTE that #define'ing TRACEMEM requires that your machine follows
 *      this:  sizeof(int) = sizeof(char*) = 32 bits. It might work
 *      for other machines to (having larger word size), but I don't
 *      guarantee it.

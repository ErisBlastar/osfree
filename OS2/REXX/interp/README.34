Changes in this release (from 3.3)
----------------------------------
o Fixed bugs 918739, 952229, 952380, 961301, 972850, 982062, 995505, 1000227,

  1109296, 1112956, 1113373
o Cygwin port will now return "UNIX" as the first word from
  PARSE SOURCE
o The default behaviour of LINEOUT(fn) has reverted back to the
  "normal" behaviour. It now behaves as a "close" of the file.
  If the STRICT_ANSI OPTION is set, it will NOT close the file.
o Regina now has support for error messages in Turkish; thanks to
  Haluk Polat
o Fix crash bug with DATE() and TIME() converting to type 'T' when date/time
  is negative.
o Improved speed of SUBSTR() BIF courtesy of Julian Onions
o Another 32-bit DOS port using OpenWatcom's DOS4G
o Better VMS support courtesy of Bernard Giroud
o Fixed minor memory leak with ADDRESS WITH
o Better support for MinGW compiler
o Builtin external libraries with static dynamic loading now displayed
  with -v command line switch to "regina" executable
o "threader" test program can now be used as a harness to test thread-safe
  Rexx programs
o ADDRESS BIF now correctly reports more details when an option of I, O or
  E is passed. This is now correct ANSI behaviour.
o Preliminary support for large files (ie > 4gb)
o Performance of large stems significantly improved.
o Use of 64bit time functions on Win32 allows negative time_t values
o EPOC32 port now builds again.
o Added PUTENV BIF to enable environment variables to be deleted.
o Changed syntax of LOWER and UPPER BIFs, to have similar arguments to
  SUBSTR. It is now possible to lower/upper case portion of a string.
o On Un*x platforms where GCI is supported, including GCI is now the default.
  If you DON'T want GCI included, configure with: --disable-gci switch
o The default type of function pointers to API functions is now
  "strongly" typed as the default. To use "weak" typing, #define
  RX_WEAKTYPING. (API developers only need to take note of this)
o Changes to allow Regina to be built with a C++ compiler.
o Fixed bug with QUALIFY BIF. Now works correctly when file does not exist.
o Added 'I' ISO DATE BIF format option.
o Documented 'J' TIME BIF format option.
o Added Object Rexx line comment; "--" based on code from Robert Hodge.
o Added .LINE reserved symbol which provides the line number of the current file
  based on code from Robert Hodge.
o Builds as native 64bit application on Windows XP 64bit.
o GCI builds under Cygwin.

Cheers, Mark.

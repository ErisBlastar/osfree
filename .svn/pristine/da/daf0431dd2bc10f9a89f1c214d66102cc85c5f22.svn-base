name: GOTO
de: Goto label
req: CMD_GOTO

SYNOPSIS:
EBNF: GOTO [ ':' ] label

Normally all commands of a <A HREF="!:batch">batch script</A> are
executed in the sequence in which they are appear with the script. GOTO
controls the command flow by unconditionally jumping to the specified
<ARG>label</ARG>; the commands following that label will be executed
then. A label is written as a colon in the first column of a line and
the name of the label immediately behind. If FreeCOM hits a label in the
normal flow, it is ignored completely, even any redirection characters
are ignored.

<P>The <ARG>label</ARG> must be located in the same script file as the
GOTO itself, if it appears more than once, the first occurance takes
precedence.

<P>Conditional jumps can be contructed with help of the IF command, see
example 2.


EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1
CMD: GOTO ende

Jumps the to label <CMD>:ende</CMD>

EXAMPLE: 2
CMD: IF "%1"=="" GOTO emptyCommandLine

Jumps to label <CMD>:emptyCommandLine</TT>, if no argument had been
passed to the batch script.
For instance:
<PRE>@ECHO OFF
IF "%1"=="" GOTO error
REM do something sane here
GOTO ende

:error
ECHO You must pass an argument to me!

:ende
</PRE>

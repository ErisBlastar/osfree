2003-02-17: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin.net>
    - Create branch STABLE. Pasha is given full access to the repository
      and should mess around in the trunk only. When anyone cares enough
      to do it stuff from the trunk can be promoted to the STABLE branch.

2002-09-10: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin.net>
    - Added and ported dbench-2.0 testcase (only the fs part is ported).

2002-04-28: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin.net>
    - Added /linenumbers to the linker command (LINK).

2001-12-21: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin.net>
    - Added performance.txt which is some comparation of the
      jfs.ifs from October 16th 2001 and HPFS386.

2001-05-14: Pavel Shtemenko <pasha@paco.odessa.ua>
	- fix for chkdsk to use Unicode APIs for file name comparisons
	  and thus avoid chkdsk removing files/directories containing
	  non ASCII characters

2001-02-12: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
	- Resurrected readme.txt.

2000-09-27: Michal Necasek <michalnec@volny.cz>
	- Several fixes and additions to make sure that the default build
	  ('NMAKE' from this directory) works correctly. Further updates
	  will follow.
	- Added XPEEK to the default target list and made sure it builds
	  cleanly. Modified some of its error messages to make them more
	  comprehensible and added a check that peeked at volume is indeed LVM
	  and not FAT or something (but doesn't identify JFS positively).

2000-04-24: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@mynd.no>
	- Corrected the corrupted FSHELPER.LIB. FSHELPER.LIB is now generated
	  from a definitionfile in the same way as KEE.LIB.

2000-04-21: Achim Hasenmueller <achimha@innotek.de>
	- first release based on Linux sources, done by
	  knut st. osmundsen.

This file lists features that are missing from Regina and are planned
to be added in future releases.

o Add macrospace API functions
o A testing suite to check out if old or new errors persists or are solved.
  - perhaps modification of the existing trip test to be cross-platform
    and to work with other interpreters would be useful
o Add execio process.

General fixes. For a list of specific known bugs and errors see BUGS file.

o Check the code where a string "FIXME" is visible.
o The documentation of the code is very poor.
o Error text for 26.5 need to have "zero or" removed

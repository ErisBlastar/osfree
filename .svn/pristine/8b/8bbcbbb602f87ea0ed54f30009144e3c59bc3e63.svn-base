stored in the first DWORD of the buffer.

ACTION: Call LogGetEntries and specify a larger buffer size.
;
;
SYS0521H: EXPLANATION: The Logging Facility buffer is full because the
information is being generated faster than it can be stored.

ACTION: Use SYSLOG to look at the log file and determine what is
causing the problem.
;
;
SYS0522H: EXPLANATION: The Logging Facility stores records in LogAddEntries
until an invalid record is found.  Each record must begin on a DWORD
boundary when multiple records are given in the LogAddEntries buffer.

ACTION: Correct the format of the LogAddEntries buffer.
;
;
SYS0523H: EXPLANATION: Currently, only logging class 1 is supported.

ACTION: Set the logging class to 1 and retry the API call.

   the disk.

ACTION: Do one or both of the following and retry the command:
o  End the other process or wait until it is complete.
o  Log on with sufficient privilege.
;
;
SYS0526H: EXPLANATION: This error might have been caused by a bad disk, a bad
Disk device driver, or incompatible disk and device driver.

ACTION: Restart your computer and re-run FORMAT with the /L switch
(valid only for the HPFS format).  If your computer will not start from
the hard disk, restart it using OS/2 or DOS from a diskette.  Then,
format the disk for the FAT (File Allocation Table) file system.  If
you can format your hard disk with OS/2 or DOS, the problem is with
the disk device driver that you were using with HPFS.  If you cannot
format the disk, it is probably unusable.
;
;
SYS0527H: EXPLANATION: The FORMAT command organizes the disk and copies
HPFS data to the disk.  The disk you want to format is either
corrupt or too small for the HPFS files.

ACTION: Try running FORMAT again.  If this does not work, use
LVM to increase the size of the volume or format the
volume for the FAT (File Allocation Table) file system used
with OS/2 or DOS.
;
;
SYS0528H: EXPLANATION: An operating system error occurred while the disk was
being formatted.  FORMAT was not able to finish formatting the
specified disk.
ACTION: Restart your computer and run FORMAT again.
;
;
SYS0529H: EXPLANATION: FORMAT requires more memory than your system
currently has available.

ACTION: End any programs that you no longer need that are
running as background processes or that are running in
other sessions and retry the command.
;
;
SYS0530H: EXPLANATION: HPFS (High Performance File System) volumes
can be created only on hard disks.

ACTION: Retry the command, specifying the drive letter
of the hard disk you want formatted.  If you want to format
a diskette, use the DOS or OS/2 FORMAT command to format the
disk for the FAT file system.
;
;
SYS0531H: EXPLANATION: HPFS (High Performance File System) can format
only one hard disk volume at a time.

ACTION: Retry the command using only one drive letter.
;
;
SYS0532H: EXPLANATION: A problem was detected with the UHPFS.DLL file.

ACTION: Copy the UHPFS.DLL file from your backup copy.  Then,
restart your system and retry the command.

SYS0542H:
;
;
SYS0543H: EXPLANATION: The correct parameters are:
drive:   Indicates the drive letter followed by a colon (such as E:),
         specifying which disk to check.
/V       Displays the name of each file as the disk is checked.
/F[:n]   Fixes the errors on the disk to the specified level of
         recovery "n" (n = 1, 2, or 3). The default is 2.

         /F:1   Fixes errors, removes corrupt files to be recovered
                later.
         /F:2   Same as /F:1, also searches orphaned areas.
         /F:3   Same as /F:2, also searches free areas for files.

         If /F is not specified, CHKDSK will only identify disk errors
         but will not correct them.

ACTION: Retry the CHKDSK command using the correct parameters.
;
;
SYS0544H: EXPLANATION: CHKDSK cannot read data from the specified drive.
Either the drive does not exist or some other process is
currently using it.

ACTION: Ensure that you specified the correct drive letter for
the disk volume you want to check.  Also, if you used
the /F parameter with CHKDSK, make sure no other program is
using that disk volume.
;
;
SYS0545H: EXPLANATION: A problem was detected with the UHPFS.DLL file.

ACTION: Copy the UHPFS.DLL file from your backup copy.  Restart
your system and retry the CHKDSK command.
;
;
SYS0546H: EXPLANATION: CHKDSK requires more memory than your system
currently has available.

ACTION: End any programs that you no longer need that are
running as background processes or that are running in other
sessions and retry the command.
;
;
SYS0547H: EXPLANATION: CHKDSK located the lost files but did not write
the recovered information to the disk yet.

ACTION: If the disk is full, delete any files that you do not
currently need and retry the CHKDSK command.
;
;
SYS0548H: EXPLANATION: CHKDSK was instructed to recover lost data but
not enough memory is available.  All of the data cannot be
recovered.

ACTION: End one or more programs that are running in other
sessions or as background processes and retry the CHKDSK command.
;
;
SYS0549H: EXPLANATION: CHKDSK is fixing errors as it finds them but does
not have enough disk space to write recovered data to the disk.

ACTION: Delete from the specified any unwanted files and retry
the command.
;
;
SYS0550H: EXPLANATION: CHKDSK did not recover any data on the disk
because it could not identify any of the directories or files.

ACTION: Restart your system and retry the CHKDSK command.
If the problem continues, restore files from your backup copy.
If this still does not fix the problem, reformat the disk.
;
;
SYS0551H: EXPLANATION: CHKDSK is trying to recover lost data even though
it cannot find the root directory of the disk.  Some of the data
might not be recovered.

ACTION: Examine the disk to see if all files were recovered.
If some files appear to be missing, run CHKDSK /F:3 to recover them.
;
;
SYS0552H: EXPLANATION: CHKDSK detected file system errors on the
specified disk.  The errors have not been corrected.

SYS0563H:
;
;
SYS0564H:
;
;
SYS0565H: EXPLANATION: Important!  Do NOT turn your computer off until you create
a backup copy of all files on the disk!  The disk might be unusable and
the file system files unreadable.  Once you turn your computer off, you
probably will not be able to access this volume.  If this is your
boot volume, you probably will not be able to restart your system.

ACTION: Use the OS/2 BACKUP command or another backup program to back
up all files and directories on the disk.  Type FORMAT, specifying the
drive and the /FS:HPFS parameter, to reformat the drive.  Then, restore
your data from the backup copy.

;
SYS0592H:
;
;
SYS0593H: EXPLANATION: The only required parameter of the RECOVER command
is the name of the file that you want to recover.

ACTION: Retry the command using a valid path name.  If necessary,
include its drive letter and path.
;
;
SYS0594H: EXPLANATION: RECOVER searched for the file you specified
but could not find it on the disk.

ACTION: Check that you typed the file name correctly.
;
;
SYS0595H: EXPLANATION: A problem was detected with the UHPFS.DLL file.

ACTION: Restart your system and retry the RECOVER command.
If the problem persists, recopy the UHPFS.DLL file from your
backup copy, restart your system, and re-run RECOVER.
;
;
SYS0596H: EXPLANATION: RECOVER requires more memory than your system
currently has available.

ACTION: End any programs that you do not need that are running
as background processes or that are running in other sessions,
and retry the RECOVER command.
;
;
SYS0597H: EXPLANATION: The disk is probably full or bad.  If you can
re-run RECOVER, the information will be recovered.

ACTION: Check if there is any free space left on the disk.  If
the disk is full or nearly full, delete any files that are no
longer needed and retry the RECOVER command.
;
;
SYS0598H: EXPLANATION: RECOVER can create up to 10,000 files named
FILEnnnn.REC (where "nnnn" is a number starting with 0000).
You attempted to exceed the number of files allowed.
ACTION: Delete or rename one or more existing FILEnnnn.REC
files and retry the RECOVER command.
;
;
SYS0599H: EXPLANATION: RECOVER was unable to read a list of extended

blocks to the disk because another process was accessing the disk.

ACTION: No action is required.  The information is now recovered.
;
;
SYS0604H: EXPLANATION: Duplicate files now exist on your disk.

ACTION: Delete the original file and rename the recovered file.
;
;
SYS0605H: EXPLANATION: Duplicate files now exist on your disk. This
can be caused if the read-only attribute of a file is set,
or if you have insufficient file access permissions.

ACTION: Check the attributes on the original file.  Also
check your own file access permissions.  If you have delete
permission, delete the original file and rename the recovered file.
;
;
SYS0606H: EXPLANATION: RECOVER detected an operating system error.

source drive.  The source and target drives cannot be the same.

ACTION: Specify another drive as the target drive.
;
;
SYS0609H: EXPLANATION: You tried to use SYS on a drive that is not
formatted for HPFS.

ACTION: Use this version of SYS only on HPFS formatted drives.
;
;
SYS0610H: EXPLANATION: The system files cannot be written to the target
disk.  This might be caused by one of the following:
o  There is no room on the disk.
o  The target disk is write-protected.
o  A file has a read-only attribute that is set.

ACTION: Do one of the following:
o  If the disk is full, delete any files that are no longer needed.
o  Determine if the disk is write-protected.  If so, remove
   the write-protection.
o  Disallow any read-only attributes on your files.

Then, if you have permission to write to the disk, retry the SYS
command.

/V[:label]   Puts the volume label on your disk.
/FS:xxxx     xxxx indicates file system type (FAT or HPFS) to be used.

ACTION: Retry the FORMAT command using the correct parameters.
;
;
SYS0630H: EXPLANATION: When a volume is formatted for HPFS, the IFS= statement
in the CONFIG.SYS file is modified.  Your CONFIG.SYS file was not
modified because the drive or drives formatted for HPFS were not
included with the /AUTOCHECK: parameter in the IFS= statement.

ACTION: Make sure that the letter of all drives that are formatted for
HPFS are included with the /AUTOCHECK: parameter in the IFS= statement
of the CONFIG.SYS file.  For example, the following statement modifies
the CONFIG.SYS file for HPFS drives D and F:
   IFS=C:\OS2\HPFS.IFS /C:64 /AUTOCHECK:DF

SYS0641H: EXPLANATION: The target drive was formatted in "fast format" mode,
which does not erase all data areas.  CHKDSK /F:3 searches data
areas for "lost" files.  If a file existed on this drive before
the last format, CHKDSK may find it, and attempt to recover it.

ACTION: Use CHKDSK /F:2 to check this drive.  If you use /F:3,
be aware that files recovered to the FOUND directories may be
old files.  Also, if you format a drive using FORMAT /L, FORMAT
will completely erase all old files, and avoid this warning.

SYS0732H: EXPLANATION: OS/2 cannot operate the disk or diskette from which you
are starting OS/2.  This may indicate that:
1. An incompatibility exists between OS/2 and the hard-disk drive
   controller, or diskette drive controller, on your system.
2. A hard-disk drive controller or diskette drive might have an
   additional device (such as a tape backup) attached to it.
3. There might be an interrupt request (IRQ) level conflict between the
   hard-disk drive controller or diskette drive and other devices
   installed on your system.
4. The hard-disk partition on which you are installing OS/2 has been
   compressed with a DOS data compression program.
ACTION: Do one of the following and retry the operation:
1. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file on the hard disk or diskette from which
   you are starting OS/2.  Remove all BASEDEV=xxxxxxxx.ADD (where
   xxxxxxxx is the name of the device driver).  Add the following
   two statements, save the CONFIG.SYS file, and restart the system:
      BASEDEV=ibm1flpy.add
      BASEDEV=ibmint13.i13
2. Disconnect any additional devices, if possible.
3. Change the IRQ levels to eliminate any conflicts.
4. Use the data compression program to decompress the partition.

ACTION: To use a specific path for the swap file, correct the
SWAPPATH= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file and restart the system.
;
;
SYS1472H: EXPLANATION: The hard disk or diskette may be full (swapping requires
a minimum of 512KB free space) or the diskette is write-protected.

ACTION: Do one of the following and then restart the system:
o  Make additional space available on the hard disk or diskette.
o  Insert a formatted diskette that is not write-protected.
o  Change the SWAPPATH= statement in CONFIG.SYS to specify a
   different drive.
;
;
SYS1473H:
;
;
SYS1474H: EXPLANATION: There is not enough system or disk memory available.

ACTION: Try one of the following and then restart the system:
o  Edit the CONFIG.SYS file to reduce the value specified in the
   BUFFERS=, TRACEBUF=, DISKCACHE=, THREADS=, or RMSIZE= statement or
   reduce the size allocated for a virtual disk in a DEVICE=VDISK.SYS
   statement.
o  Install another memory option in your system unit.
o  Use the ERASE command to delete unwanted files on the swap disk or
   use the COPY command to copy them to a different disk.
;
;
SYS1475H: EXPLANATION: This is a hidden system file and must reside in the root directory
of the drive from which the operating system is started, or the OS2BOOT file
might be missing.

diskette or CD-ROM to restart your computer.
;
;
SYS1476H: EXPLANATION: The path specified is incorrect.  It must be the name of

ACTION: To use a specific path for the swap file, correct the
SWAPPATH= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file and restart the system.
;
;
SYS1477H: EXPLANATION: The system requires additional virtual memory, but
cannot expand the size of the swap file to satisfy this request.

ACTION: Reduce the virtual memory requirement by closing applications
or increase the amount of available space on the volume by deleting
unwanted files.  If the SWAPPER.DAT file is full (message reoccurs),
you may need to change the default location of your swap file.  Refer
to the SWAPPATH command in the online Command Reference for additional
information.

SYS1502H: EXPLANATION: A portion of the swap file is mapped to a bad sector on
the hard disk.  The system cannot read the specific segment in this
area of the swap file.

ACTION: Depending on the location of the swap file (SWAPPER.DAT),
do one of the following:

If the swap file is located on the C: volume (the default location
for the swap file):
  1. Restart the system using an OS/2 or DOS startup diskette.
  2. Backup to diskette non-OS/2 system files located on the C:
     volume.
  3. Reinstall OS/2, then select the option to format the C: volume.
  4. Restore the files you backed up in Step 2.

If the swap file is located on a volume other than C:
  1. Restart the system using an OS/2 or DOS startup diskette.
  2. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and change the SWAPPATH statement so that
     the swap file is located on the C: volume.  (For example,
     SWAPPATH=C:\OS2\SYSTEM 512)
  3. Restart OS/2 from the hard disk (the usual way).
  4. If required, perform an error recovery.  You might need to
     reformat the volume that contained the bad sector.
OPTIONAL:
  5. Backup to diskette all files on the volume containing the bad
     sector.
  6. Reformat that volume.
  7. Restore the files you backed up in Step 5.

If the above procedure fails, then:
  1. Use the Hardware Reference Diskette and select the format option.
  2. Perform a low-level format of the entire hard disk.
  3. Reinstall OS/2.

If this procedure fails, then:
  1. Replace the hard disk.
  2. Install OS/2.
  3. Restore all files you backed up.

;
SYS3001H: EXPLANATION: You are trying to access through
the prompt a drive that no longer exists.

ACTION: Specify a valid drive.
;
;
SYS3002H:
;
;
SYS3003H: EXPLANATION: In COMMAND.COM, the correct syntax for specifying the
environment size in bytes is /E:n, where n is from 160 to 32768.
One of the following has occurred:
o  You specified a number that is too large (above 32768) or
   too small (below 160).
o  You specified a character other than a number, for example,
   /E:1024a.

ACTION: Change the call to COMMAND.COM to a valid environment size
for future use.  Because COMMAND.COM started, no immediate action is
needed.
;
;
SYS3004H: EXPLANATION: OS/2 does not support redirecting of standard input,
standard output, and standard error to any device other than the
console (default).

ACTION: If CTTY was used to start a new copy of COMMAND.COM, then the
call to COMMAND.COM needs to be changed.
;
;
SYS3005H: EXPLANATION: One of the following has occurred:
1. You tried to add a new variable or change an existing one
   with the SET command, but not enough space is available
   in the current environment to perform the operation.
2. Too small an environment space was specified with the
   COMMAND.COM /E option.

ACTION: Do one of the following:
1. Eliminate environment variables that are not needed.
2. Start COMMAND.COM and specify a larger environment size.
;
;
SYS3006H: EXPLANATION: A new copy of COMMAND.COM was started with the default
COMSPEC=\COMMAND.COM.  Also, the new COMMAND.COM does not inherit any
environment settings.

ACTION: Change the call to COMMAND.COM to a valid drive or path for
future use.  Because COMMAND.COM started, no immediate action is
needed.
;
;
SYS3007H: EXPLANATION: PATH= contains a reference to an invalid drive or path.

ACTION: Type PATH to display the current PATH= setting.  Correct the
invalid path or drive specification and retry the command.
;
;
SYS3008H:
;
;
SYS3009H:
;
;
SYS3010H: EXPLANATION: One of the following has occurred:
o  There is not enough memory to load COMMAND.COM.
o  The memory control blocks have been corrupted.

ACTION: Type EXIT to end the current copy of COMMAND.COM and retry the
operation.
;
;
SYS3011H: EXPLANATION: There is an internal error in the format of the .EXE file.
The program cannot be run as it now exists.

ACTION: Contact the supplier of the application.
;
;
SYS3012H: EXPLANATION: Not enough memory is available to process this command.

ACTION: Type EXIT to end the current copy of COMMAND.COM and retry the
operation.
;
;
SYS3013H: EXPLANATION: The attempt to start the .EXE or .COM file failed.
The problem is NOT one of the following error conditions:
o  File not found.
o  Access denied.
o  Insufficient memory.
o  Bad load module format.

The program cannot be run as it now exists.

ACTION: Contact the supplier of the application.
;
;
SYS3014H: EXPLANATION: The name specified should be for one of the following:
o  A DOS internal command.
o  A DOS external command.
o  An executable program with file extension .EXE or .COM.
o  A batch file whose file extension is .BAT.

Except for DOS internal commands, if a path for the command was not
specified at the command prompt, the file must reside in the current
directory or in one of the directories specified by PATH.

ACTION: Retry the command using a correct name or path.
;
;
SYS3015H: EXPLANATION: One of the following has occurred:
1. The COMMAND.COM specified by the COMSPEC environment variable
   cannot be found.
2. The COMMAND.COM specified by the COMSPEC environment variable is
   the wrong version of COMMAND.COM.
3. An error occurred while trying to read COMMAND.COM from disk.

ACTION: Do the following:
1. Type SET to display the current environment variables.
2. Ensure that the COMSPEC variable is specifying a valid version of
   COMMAND.COM.
3. Ensure that COMMAND.COM is the version loaded when the virtual
   DOS machine was started.

Note: You cannot change copies of COMMAND.COM by changing COMSPEC.
      You must load a secondary copy into memory.
;
;
SYS3016H: EXPLANATION: COMMAND.COM cannot be loaded from a permanent DOS session
using the /P option.  The session was halted because there is no
permanent copy of COMMAND.COM to return to.

ACTION: Close the DOS session.  No other activity can be performed.
Correct the COMSPEC variable to prevent this from occurring again.

Note: You cannot change copies of COMMAND.COM by changing COMSPEC.
      You must load a secondary copy into memory.
;
;
SYS3017H: EXPLANATION: COMMAND.COM could not be reloaded from a DOS session.  The
session was either a secondary copy of COMMAND.COM or a single command
option (/C).  In either case, the copy of COMMAND.COM is ended and you
are returned to the caller of COMMAND.COM.

ACTION: Correct the COMSPEC variable to prevent this from occurring
again.  Note that you cannot change copies of COMMAND.COM by changing
COMSPEC.  You must load a secondary copy into memory.
;
;
SYS3018H:
;
;
SYS3019H: EXPLANATION: The BREAK, ECHO, or VER command tried to use a parameter
other than ON or OFF.

ACTION: Retry the command with the correct parameter.
;
;
SYS3020H: EXPLANATION: One or more devices failed during the selection of a
code page.

ACTION: Be sure the correct code page file is specified in the
CONFIG.SYS file.  You must restart the system to make the revised
CONFIG.SYS file active.
;
;
SYS3021H: EXPLANATION: You cannot use the binary option (/B) on a device.
Copying from devices only uses ASCII files.

ACTION: Retry the COPY command without /B after the source device name.
;
;
SYS3022H: EXPLANATION: The device cannot handle the number of bytes requested.

ACTION: Change the amount of data in the file and retry the operation.
;
;
SYS3023H:
;
;
SYS3024H: EXPLANATION: A FOR statement cannot be used inside another FOR
statement.

ACTION: Remove the nested FOR and retry the operation.
;
;
SYS3025H: EXPLANATION: An invalid number of parameters was given to the command.

ACTION: Correct the number of parameters and retry the command.
Refer to the Command Reference for the correct number of parameters.
;

SYS3028H:
;
;
SYS3029H:
;
;
SYS3030H: EXPLANATION: The ASSIGN command requires two drive letters.
No action was taken because the second drive letter was missing.

ACTION: Retry ASSIGN and specify a second drive letter.
;
;
SYS3031H: EXPLANATION: The character is not valid as a drive specification
because it is not a letter or the drive is not available on this system.

ACTION: Retry ASSIGN and specify a valid drive letter.
;
;
SYS3032H: EXPLANATION: The character is not valid as a separator.  The only valid
separators are space, tab, line feed, and the following characters:
+  ,  =  ;

ACTION: Retry the ASSIGN command and specify a valid separator.
;
;
SYS3033H: EXPLANATION: The character specified is not valid with this command.

ACTION: Retry the command with a valid switch character.  For more
information about switches, refer to the Command Reference or go to
an OS/2 command prompt and type: HELP xxxxxx, where "xxxxxx" is the
name of the command you tried using with the switch.

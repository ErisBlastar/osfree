GLOSSARY
========================================================================

     block
          A portion of the file being edited; usually highlighted.
          A block can be one of <line block>, <box block>, <word block>,
          <column block>, or <stream block>.

     Bottom-of-File line
          A line marker, identifying the end of the file.

     box block
          A type of <block>.  It is a rectangular portion of the 
          <filearea>.

     column block
          A type of <block>.  It is similar to a <box block> except that
          a columnar portion of every line in the file is included.

     column target
          A method of referring to some part of a line being edited.

     command line
          The area of the display, usually identified by an arrow
          prompt, "====>", where THE commands are entered.

     current column
          The column in the <filearea>, marked by the "|" character on
          the <scale line>.

     current line
          The line in the <filearea>, normally highlighted, from which
          commands entered on the <command line> take effect.

     cursor field
          The "field" in which the cursor is currently located. This
          can be the <prefix area>, <command line> or <filearea>.

     filearea
          That part of the screen display where the contents of the
          file being edited are displayed.

     focus column
          The column in the <filearea> which currently has the focus. If
          the cursor is in the <filearea>, it is the column on which the 
          cursor is displayed. If the cursor is in the <command line> or
          <prefix area>, the focus column is the <current column>.

     focus line
          The line in the <filearea> which currently has the focus. If
          the cursor is in the <filearea> or <prefix area>, it is the line
          on which the cursor is displayed. If the cursor is on the
          <command line>, the focus line is the <current line>. All THE
          commands operate relative to the focus line.

     idline
          That part of the screen display which shows details about
          the file being edited.

     line block
          A type of <block>.  It consists of consecutive lines within
          the <filearea>.

     macro
          A file containing a sequence of THE commands. Macros can
          be written in <REXX> if a supported REXX interpreter is
          available.

          *** NOTE ***

          If REXX support is NOT enabled in THE, the first line of the THE
          macro file MUST contain the comment:

          /*NOREXX*/

     magic number
          A magic number is used on Un*x systems to identify the type of
          a file. It was originally used in binary files to identify the
          file, but the concept was also extended to text files; 
          particularly shell scripts; to enable to shell to determine
          which interpreter should be used to execute the contents of a
          file. These magic numbers in text files are really magic "strings"
          and it is these strings that are used by the THE syntax
          highlighting feature to automatically determine the <parser> to be
          used to highlight a file.

     message line
          That portion of the screen used to display messages.

     prefix area
          That part of the screen display where prefix commands can
          be entered. It also displays the line number of each line
          in the file if <SET NUMBER> is ON.

     parser
          A mechanism that translates text strings into identifiable
          tokens.

     profile
          A <macro> file that is executed at the start of an editing
          session.

     relative target
          A subset of <target>, but only supports targets that are
          relative to the <focus line>, like 3, -5, *.

     reserved line
          A line within the <filearea> that contains user text that
          the user can define with the <SET RESERVED> command.

     REXX
          A powerful, easy-to-learn macro language available on most
          platforms. THE uses REXX as its macro language.

     ring
          The set of files currently being edited are arranged in a
          ring formation.

     scale line
          A line in the <filearea> showing column positions.

     shadow line
          A line which signifies how many lines have been excluded
          from display. See <SET SHADOW>, <SET SELECT>.

     status line
          That part of the screen display showing details about the
          entire THE session.

     stream block
          A type of <block>.  It is a stream of characters that span 
          one or more consecutive lines in the <filearea>.

     string target
          A subset of <target> that refers to a string of characters
          enclosed between <string target delimiter>s.

     string target delimiter
          The character that determines the start and optional ending
          of a <string target>.  A delimiter can consist of one of the
          following characters:
            /\@`#$%(){}[]"\<>

     tab line
          A line in the <filearea> which displays the currently set
          TAB stops.

     target
          A method of referring to some part of the file being edited.

     Top-of-File line
          A line marker, identifying the beginning of the file.

     vershift
          An internal number which defines the number of columns the
          displayed text is offset from the verify setting as a result
          of automatically scrolling horizontally, or by the use of
          the <LEFT>, <RIGHT>, or <RGTLEFT> commands.

     word block
          A type of <block>.  It consists of a contiguous series of
          characters that comprise a word.  A word is defined by the
          current setting of <SET WORD>.

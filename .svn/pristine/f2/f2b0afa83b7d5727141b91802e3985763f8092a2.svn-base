This file contains 32 bit executables of the Regina Rexx interpreter for

Copy the .EXE files into a directory in your PATH and copy the .DLL
files into a directory in your LIBPATH.

This version of Regina requires libc063.dll; the runtime for gcc 3.3.5.

If you want to have Regina error messages displayed in you native
language, set the environment variable; REGINA_LANG to the two-character
language abbreviation (the first two chracters of a file in the NLS
directory), and set REGINA_LANG_DIR to the directory containing the
*.mtb files.

If building Regina from source, always unzip the source to convert the
Unix end of line characters to OS/2 carriage return/end of line characters.
With InfoZip, this is "unzip -a".

Cheers, Mark.

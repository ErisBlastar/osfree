This is the release history for FIND:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ver 2.9: Adjusted KITTEN to fit my needs better (Eric Auer).

Ver 2.7: Added support for NLS in case-insensitivity, changed from
 cats to kitten library, removed getopt, made binary smaller, fixed
 a bug in backslash processing (Eric Auer). Same for version 2.8.

Ver 2.6: Fixed bug 1423 (FIND does not use filename paths).  This now
 stores the drive, cwd before using findfirst/findnext.  Some code

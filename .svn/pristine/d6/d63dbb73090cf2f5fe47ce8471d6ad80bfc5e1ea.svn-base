What is ext2flt?
----------------

ext2flt.flt is a filter device driver for OS/2 that makes it possible to
load an IFS for linux partitions. (Without this filter you must patch the
partition table. On many systems doing so may cause LILO to fail.)

In addition this driver is capable to control in what order drive letters
are assigned to partitions on fixed disks. It will also allow you to access
hidden primary partitions under OS/2.

The goal of this filter is to allow you to use ext2-os2.ifs without breaking
anything else... :-)

NOTE: You need ext2-os2.ifs to access the files on a linux (ext2) partition.

Conditions of use:
------------------

You are free to use the filter in any way you wish to, free of charge. I
would however like it very much if you can drop me a note on a postcard.
The source code is available under the GPL license. (If you want to use
the source, but not under GPL, contect me and we can work out something.)

How it works:
-------------

A virtual fixed disk is created for each partition under control of the driver.
These virtual fixed disks each contain one extended partition with a logical
drive in it. Since OS2DASD.DMD that controls fixed disks first assigns drive
letters to primary partitions the virtual partitions are tacked on at the end
of allocated drive letters. (To control the mounting order of all partitions
OS2DASD is prevented from directly accessing the fixed disks and the filter
presents it with an alternate list of partitions.)

Installing the filter:
----------------------

Add a line:

BASEDEV= EXT2FLT.FLT <options>

to your config.sys file. The following command line options are allowed:

/Q              Quiet install. Prevents the filter from displaying messages.
/V              Verbose install. Displays some diagnostic messages.
/W              Allows the virtual partitions to be written to.
/A              Virtualize all partitions found. The only good reason to use
                this is along with the /M option when you want to control
                the mounting order of all the partitions. You must use the
                /W option if you use the /A option; otherwise OS/2 may crash
                 when it tries to write to the partition.
                PLEASE NOTE: Using the /A option may change your drive
                letters causing the your system to be unbootable. Use
                the /M option together with /A. (This may change in the
                future.

/M <mount list> Mounts the partitions in the order specified in the mount
                list, which should be a list of numbers separated by commas.
                The partitions are numbered 0 on a first come basis. (Not
                the OS/2 uses.)

If something goes wrong:
------------------------

I do not accept any repsonsability for any damage that this driver may
cause. (Remember, you installed it...) I would like to hear about it so that
I can try to fix it.

Contacting me:
--------------

If you have ideas for the driver or feel like general discussion or whatever
you can contact me at vdwest@quark.cs.sun.ac.za. That address will remain
valid until November 95. After that please use the snail mail address.

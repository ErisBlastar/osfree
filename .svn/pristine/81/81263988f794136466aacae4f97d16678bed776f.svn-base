<title>Keymaps</title>

<para>
This keymap is for using dosemu over telnet, and
having *all* your keys work.  This keymap is not complete.  But
hopefully with everyones help it will be someday :)
</para>

<para>
There are a couple of things that are intentionally
broken with this keymap, most noteably F11 and F12.  This is because
they are not working though slang correctly at the current instant.
I have them mapped to "greyplus" and "greyminus".  Also the scroll
lock is mapped to shift-f3.  This is because the scroll lock dosn't
work right at all.  Please feel free to send keymap patches in that
fix anything but these.
</para>

<para>
If you want to patch <emphasis>dosemu</emphasis> to fix either of those problems, i'd be
<emphasis>glad</emphasis> to accept those :)
</para>

<para>
to figure out how to edit this, read the keystroke-howto.
</para>

<para>
as of 3/30/95, control/shift/alternate
home/insert/delete/end/pageup/pagedown should work.  
</para>

<para>
Major issues will be:

<para>
Do we move "alt-&lt;fkey&gt;" to "control-&lt;fkey&gt;" to switch virtual
consoles?
</para>

<para>
who is going to fix the linux keyboard device to be able to handle
multiple keymaps at the same time?

--------------------------------------------------------
</para>

<para>
to use it:
</para>

<para>
as root type

<screen>
	loadkeys dosemu.new.keymap
</screen>

</para>

<para>
(then run dosemu via telnet, or something in slang mode)
</para>

<para>
when your done, find your old keymap, and load it back, cause
control-home won't work in emacs anymore (or any other special key in
any applicaion that uses xlate)
</para>

<para>
if you find a key missing, please add it and send me the patch.  (test
it first! :)
</para>

<para>
if you find a key missing, and don't feel like coding it, <emphasis>don't tell
me</emphasis>!  I already know that there are a lot of keys missing.

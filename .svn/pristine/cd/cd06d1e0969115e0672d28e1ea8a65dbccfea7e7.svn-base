The programs udps.cmd and udpc.cmd are examples of a UDP server and a
UDP client, respectively.  They work together as a test for
RXSOCK.DLL.  To run the tests:

1.  Start the server by typing the following in a command window:
   [d:\data\devl\rxlibs\rxsock] regina udps.cmd

   A message will be printed telling you which port was assigned to
   the socket.

2.  Start the client by typing the following in a different command
    window:
   [d:\data\devl\rxlibs\rxsock] regina udpc.cmd 192.9.0.1 2000

   Substitute your machine's IP address for 192.9.0.1 and the port
   number reported in step 1 for 2000.

The server will then display a message telling you what message it
received.

File format of .DB files:

Header:
na)me: of object described herein; should match the filename
de)scription: one line description
eq)ual to: name of object 100% equal to this one, no further entries
	allowed
se)e also: references
re)quirements: which other objects this object depends on
op)tional: optional requirements for certain features
co)nflicts: which other objects this object conflicts with

<empty line>	-- delimits header and body

Body: The rest of the file is plain HTML text, except:

+ <OPT>...</OPT> encloses names of options
+ <ARG>...</ARG> encloses names of arguments
+ <CMD>...</CMD> encloses a command line embedded into HTML text
+ <HELL>...</HELL> encloses text to set "bright" (e.g. red colour)
+ <DIMM>...</DIMM> encloses text to set "dark" (e.g. dark gray colour)
+ CMD: prefixes a line that solemny consits of a command line
	also quotes all HTML characters
+ EBNF: prefixes a line that solemny consists of a EBNF expression
+ EBNF!: prefixes a line that solemny consists of a EBNF expression, which
is part of the surrounding HTML text.
+ Labels (aka: <A NAME="letters">) are mangeled to automatically be unique
throughout the whole generated HTML files.
+ References to labels must be written like this:
<A HREF="object:label"> where "object" is the name of the object the
label is part of; an empty label references to the object itself, an
empty object  references to the label within the same object.
Both 'object' and 'label' must consist of letters only.

The special object "!" refers to a central explanation location:
	!:wildcards	Explains how wildcards are matched and their syntax
	!:options	Explains how options are parsed standardly
	!:path		Explains how path specification is formatted, abs/rel path
The special object "!!" refers to the FreeCOM.html primary source.

HREF's with a leading "ftp/http/about" are considered "absolute"
hyperlinks and are not mangled.
Hyperlinks local to a certain HTML file should beginn with a dash. And
their HREF's should be complete (beginning with the hash mark '#').

+ SYNOPSIS: is substituted by a "Synopsis" section header line.
+ ARGUMENTS: is substituted by a "Arguments" section header line.
+ OPTIONS: is substituted by a "Options" section header line.
+ STD_OPTIONS: is substituted by a standard "Options" section header line
	including the reference to how to format options.
+ EXAMPLES: is substituted by a "Examples" section header line.
+ EXAMPLE: <<string>> is substituted by a "Example <<string>>"
	subsection header line.

EBNF (enhanced Backus-Naur-Format):
+ Tokens must be surrounded by at least one whitespace.
+ Tokens must not contain whitespaces.
+ Variants of tokens:
++ first character is a capitol letter:
	Fixed part of a command, set in <CMD> tags.
++ first character is a lower-case letter:
	Variable part of a command, a place holder; set in <I> tags.
++ a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes:
	Characters to be written on command line; set in <CMD> tags
	quotes not stripped.
++ else:
	Metacharacters for EBNF:
+++ ( ) narrows other operators
+++ | either left or right token list (*)
+++ [ ] encloses optional tokens, which may appear exactly once or not at all.
+++ { } encloses tokens, which must appear at least once.
+++ { : } as { }, but the tokens placed right of the colon are to be inserted
	between two or more apearances of the tokens left of the colon (**)
+++ ::= assignes a meaning to a placeholder.
+++ << >> encloses an informal comment (expressed in natural language) (***)
+++ No special metacharacter is required to form a sequence of tokens.
+ Spaces, which must appear on the command line, are usually not explicitly
	expressed within EBNF neither does the existance of a space imply that
	such space must be entered on command line, see (***).
	It is assumed that the reader knows the basic rules where to have to
	insert spaces.


(*) A sequence of |'s form an either-or-operator.
(**) E.g.: COPY { srcfile : '+' } dstfile
	is a short-hand form of:	COPY srcfile [{ '+' srcfile }] dstfile
(***) E.g.: SET varname '=' <<any string>>

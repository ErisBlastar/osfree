	FILE *Fxopen(char *fnam, char *mode)

	Open a file as Fopen(); create extended attributes and chain them
	into the list of extended attributes.

	If the returned FILE* pointer is closed by fclose() rather than
	Fxclose(), the extended attributes remain in memory an could
	return invalid information, if used, if the compiler re-uses
	FILE* pointers, e.g. Borland C.

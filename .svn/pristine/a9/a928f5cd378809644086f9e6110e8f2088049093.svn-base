davesim is a Rexx program that checks stock market quotations every 15
minutes.  It is named after someone I used to work with.

Every 15 minutes, it connects to the site www.freerealtime.com, downloads the
requested stock quotations, and prints the results.  Note that
freerealtime.com does require registration, although registration is free.

To use davesim, change the first three lines of the program to reflect your
freerealtime username, password, and stock symbols of interest.  If you want
to change the update interval from the default 15 minutes, change the value of
the variable globals.!updateInterval in the function InitGlobals.

Enjoy,

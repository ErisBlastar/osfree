        DOSCALLS design and implementation (draft).
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DOSCALLS in modern OS/2 contains implementation of all (or most) Control
Program API. Many other DLLs just forwarders to DOSCALLS. We also uses
such logic. Only difference is DOSCALLS not lowest library. DOSCALLS
also divided onto two libs. DOSCALLS itself, which contains kernel independed
parts, and KAL library, which contains kernel depended part. For osFree
project KAL just forward all calls to OS/2 Personality server and recieves
answer from it with call result. Such approach allow to port CPI to other
kernel easely, because kernel-depended part cleary divided into
separate layer.

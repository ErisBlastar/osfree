What about including those files into the archiving list
KEYFILE:C:\MMOS2\MMPM2.INI
KEYFILE:C:\MMOS2\MMPMCD.INI
KEYFILE:C:\MMOS2\MMPMCONN.INI
KEYFILE:C:\MMOS2\MMPMMMIO.INI
if they are not already in the list?

So the user will also archive those. Are there any more critical files?
I could implement those, when base installation is done. The files could stay in the archiving list, because 
archiver will ignore missing files (afaik, not sure about it).

Good idea?
Anyway, I'm still going to do internal backupping of MMPM2.INI, because that's human-read/writeable. I will 
generate \MMOS2\MMPM2.BAK and +R+H+S it, this was taken from the "standard" that the WPS uses with 
its INI files.

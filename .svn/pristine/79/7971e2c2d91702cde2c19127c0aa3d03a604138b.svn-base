This directory contains some REXX code that is meant to make a 
REXX interpreter trip in obscure (and not-so-obscure) features.

All the files having filetype '.rexx' are files checking for possible
problems. The 'testing' program is just a small rexx script to run all
the tests in sequence. 

Note that some of the tests use the program 'rc', which is a small C
program that just exits with a returncode equal to its first
parameter. You'll have to compile, using something like (it's a very
small and nice program, and it should really not create any problems):

    cc -o rc rc.c

The tests also use "true", and "std", so compile this the same way as rc.c

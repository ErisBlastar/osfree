<P>By pressing ^Break or ^C (Control-Break or Control-C) an user
may signal the currently running program to halt. Most programs will
abort to the prompt, but some may decide to just cancel the current
action, but remain active.

a program issues a console input/output request. When Extended Break
checking is enabled (<EM>ON</EM>), DOS checks for ^Break each time
a program issues a request.

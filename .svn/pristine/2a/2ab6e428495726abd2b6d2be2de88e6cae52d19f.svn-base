sh(ort description): Return the EOF status of a stream

	Returns the EOF (end of file) status of the stream / \tok{(FILE*)} pointer.
	\par
	Note: Due to the fact that Micro-C does not have neither
	feof() nor ungetc(), this function returns true for all
	files opened in write mode, and uses fseek() to simulate an
	ungetc().

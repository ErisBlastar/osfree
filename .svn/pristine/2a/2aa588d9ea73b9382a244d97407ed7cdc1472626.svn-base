                  Patch level 1 release by Jon B. Volkoff,
                              15 March 1996


LIST OF PATCHES TO 2.20:

bwb_cnd.c

   Moved init routine for bwb_while so that it would be initialized regardless
   of expression value, not just if TRUE.  This was causing some segmentation
   faults in WHILE-WEND loops.

bwb_elx.c

   Plugged gaping memory leak.  Temp variable space for expression evaluation
   was being allocated but not freed when done (oops!).

bwb_fnc.c

   Added check for NULL return from getenv to prevent segmentation faults.

bwbasic.h
   Revised VERSION define to reflect above changes.

To implement these patches simply replace the old versions of the above source
files with the new ones and remake bwbasic.

Out of a posting from Julia A. Case <julie@MageNet.com>

I'm not much of a documentation writer so if all this doesn't make sense
feel free to write me at julie@MageNet.com for more info.  I wanted a
better way of running doors than in local mode via dosemu.  And this is what
I managed to do to fix that problem.

This patch will allow you to add an additional keyword to the serial
configuration in dosemu.conf.  The 'virtual' flag will allow you to set the
current tty that dosemu is running on to be a virtual modem.  For things to
work right you need to make the following changes in your dosemu.conf file.

1.  Remove all video definitions but the terminal.  This forces terminal
mode.  Which we need to avoid local video.
2.  add serial { virtual com 1 }  this makes the current tty COM1
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(**Note from Hans: this is $_comX = "virtual" for dosemu-1.0.1
                 X being one of 1,2,3,4)

Now when you run an dosemu it will only display the data that is going to
the COM port.  A DOS door can be run in remote mode vs. the local mode that
we have all been running them in.  On bug that I've found is that on a
non-modem tty the speed defaults to 2400 baud.  I tried to change this in
dosemu, but it really didn't work.  What I did find that works though is to
get down X00v150.ZIP.  X00 is a very good fossil, which some doors will
need, beyond that though it has a utility called XU.EXE that lets you set
the port speed, I call this from autoexec and set the port speed to 57600
and everything works fine.

This should allow for RIPScrip doors to be run, but at present my testing
has show the acceptance of my terminal being RIP compatable to be less than
reliable.  I'm not sure what is causing that.  I'll keep looking at it
though.

I've run the following doors via this mode.  
        1.  Solar Realms Elite
        2.  Barren Realms Elite
        3.  Falcons Eye
        4.  Global Wars
        5.  Terra Firma
        6.  Legend of the Red Dragon
        7.  Exitilus

From reynirhs@isl.is:

Reopening a closed stream causes a segfault under Linux. This is known
to happen in version 2.20, including pl1 and pl2.

As I understand it, there are two different types of closed streams:
   DEVMODE_AVAILABLE = Completely fresh, no buffer attached.
   DEVMODE_CLOSED    = Pre-owned, still has a buffer.

The problem is this: bwb_close() marks a closed file as _CLOSED but
then frees the buffer (if it was a random file) and NULLs the buffer
pointer. Should you then reopen it as a random file, bwb_open() will
assume that, since the stream is marked _CLOSED, it will still have a
buffer attached from before. Please note that dev_table[].buffer is
still NULL at this point.

The diff below is a simple fix for the resulting explosion.

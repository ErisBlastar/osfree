                          Regina 3.2
                        25 April 2003

Changes in this release (from 3.1)
----------------------------------
o Changed the problematic building of thread-safe shared libraries introduced 
  with 3.1.
  Building of separate libraries for the single-threaded and thread-safe shared 
  libraries WAS meant to make things easier, but it made things worse. So, 
  only one shared library is ever built. If threads are supported, the Regina
  shared library is thread-safe. If threads are not supported, then the Regina
  shared library is single-thread only. PARSE VERSION will identify whether the
  interpreter is thread-safe or not.
  Win32, OS/2, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD will have thread-safe shared libraries
  built by default.
o Builds on Unix platforms with gcc no longer use soname for the shared library.
o Fixed bug 722717 - Regina not handling string constants correctly in loops,
  if the strings are valid numbers.
o Fixed bug 724390 - Incorrect parsing of strings like '003'x1
o Fixed crash with CRYPT BIF under Windows.
o Documented threader.c sample program.
o Error handling is now thread-safe.
o Reduced memory leak with thread-safe library.
o Added --disable-posix-threads to NOT build the thread-safe version of
  libregina.so on platforms where the default is to build the thread-safe
  version.
o Changed the behaviour of LINEIN to be more consistent with Object Rexx.
  Regina will now treat a line as any string of characters that ends in
  CRLF, LF, or CR on all platforms.

Cheers, Mark.

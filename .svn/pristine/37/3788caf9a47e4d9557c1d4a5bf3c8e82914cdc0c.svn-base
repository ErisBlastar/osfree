                     RXSOCK.DLL for Win9x/NT/2K/XP

This file contains version 1.4 of RXSOCK.DLL for Win9x/NT/2K/XP.
Also included is the C source code for the DLL and some demo 
programs using the interface.

RXSOCK is a socket library for Rexx.  Its interface is compatible
with the one provided by IBM with OS/2 and with Object Rexx for
Windows.  See http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/rexxtut/socktut1.htm for a
description of the API.

RXSOCK should work with five different Rexx interpreters: Regina,
Enterprise Rexx (aka WinRexx) on Intel, Enterprise Rexx on Alpha,
IBM Object Rexx, and Quercus System's Personal Rexx.  I can support
only the first two directly as those are the only Rexx interpreters
I have.

Earlier versions of RXSOCK provided a different DLL for each Rexx
interpreter.  Starting with version 1.2, I am provided a single DLL
that will work with Mark Hessling's REXXTRANS to work with all
four of the Intel-based Rexx interpreters.  I also include a DLL
provided by Enterprise, Inc. that works with their NT/Alpha Rexx
interpreter.

Users of Object Rexx for Windows should note that IBM provides a
RXSOCK.  If you copy this to your ObjectRexx directory you will
probably overwrite the IBM-supplied version.

The differences between this RXSOCK and the one provided with OS/2 4.0
are listed in the file differences.os2, which you should have received
with this file.

To install, simply copy RXSOCK.DLL and REXXTRANS.DLL to a directory that is in
you PATH environment variable.  Use the RxFuncAdd() function to make the
library available to your Rexx programs.

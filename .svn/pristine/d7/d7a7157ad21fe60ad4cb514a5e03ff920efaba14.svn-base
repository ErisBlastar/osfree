sh(ort description): Match two filename components using Win32-style pattern match
he(ader files): 
lo(ng description): Matches two filename components, if they match each other
	honoring wildcard patterns. Wildcards may appear everywhere, even in
	the drive spec. \tok{.} and \tok{..} components are \em{not} removed, but
	matched literally. The following tokens are recognized:
	\item \tok{?}: any, but one character
	\item \tok{*}: none or more characters
	\item \tok{/} and \tok{\\}: delimiter of components, any non-empty sequence
	\item \tok{:}: delimiter of components, but doesn't match \tok{/}
	\endlist
	The following components are recognized specifically:
	\item \tok{*}: any filename
	\item \tok{*.*}: any filename with at least one dot in it
	\item \tok{*.}: any filename with no dot in it, or a dot at the very end.
	\endlist
	There are no assumptions how long a component is, how many dots it
	contains or which characters it is constructed of (except for the
	specially recognized characters and '\0'). Dots may start or end
	a component.\par

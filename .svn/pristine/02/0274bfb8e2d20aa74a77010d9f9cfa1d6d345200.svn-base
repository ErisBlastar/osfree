Hello, and Welcome to Hyperoid version 1.1!

The object of the game is intuitive---shoot everything! (Well, almost
everything, heh heh!). If the keyboard buffer overflows in all the
excitement, ignore the beeps you hear and they'll go away.

Hyperoids uses the palette manager, so if you have a palette-capable display
(and you read the on-line help pages) you should be able to set up better
colors than the Windows defaults. I have tested hyperoids on a monochrome
'286, and it seems to work fine. If you want to re-map the keys, look at
Appendix A (or the Windows SDK) for some non-ASCII virtual key codes.

The source is available through the same channel that you got the executable
through, as per the GNU general public licence. Please read the licence if
you have any questions, or contact me at the above addresses (email
preferred).

If you make modifications/bug fixes to Hyperoid, please use me as a clearing
house to prevent versions flooding out into the universe. (You don't have to,
but I'd appreciate it :-). If you write the world's greatest game using some
of my source, please send me note telling what it is and where it's available.

Changes since 1.0:
	Explosion processing a little faster
	Swarmers (little green guys) no longer flood the system
	Scoring is better
	Extra lives every 100,000 points (not 50,000)
	Firepower reduced a little (hey, the game was too darn easy)
	Spinning Game Over (Oooooh...)

Look for:
  ls - *nix ls command with MUCHO bells&whistles (couldn't live w/out it!)
  blitfix - util that sets the CS_BYTEALIGNCLIENT bit on all top windows
			(speeds up my 1024x768 display by a factor of 3)
  eyecon - xeyes clone (may have to be renamed)
  ilbm - Amiga IFF bitmap viewer (supports HAM mode and palettes!)
  life - 7 blit life with a few bells&whistles
  loadmon - nifty system performance monitor
  mbrot - mandelbrot hack that runs in the background
  yow - Zippy the Pinhead in his very own icon, telling it like it is
  (more games... stuff... junk...)
Coming real soon now to a (net,BBS,Wherever this stuff ends up) near YOU!

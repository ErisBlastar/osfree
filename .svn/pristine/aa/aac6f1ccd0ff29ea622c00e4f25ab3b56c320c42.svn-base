LIST OF THINGS TO WORK ON

* F2 and F3

The only missing features of MS edlin are the handling of these control keys
when editing lines.  The reason I haven't done anything to this section is
because I want FreeDOS edlin to work as well under Linux as it does under
FreeDOS, and handling of special keys is more difficult (and different) under
Linux because I figure I'd probably have to throw in a termcap handler or
something similar.

* Error handling

The error handling in edlin is grubby at best. I would like to see it worked
on.

* Internationalization of outputted messages.

To speed internationalization, all the output messages are in msgs.h.
Internationalization should just be a matter of copying a particular
file to msgs.h and voila, instant internationalization!

I eventually want to get translations of all the languages in which it is
possible to use the ISO 8859-1 character set. The following is a status
list:

LANGUAGE                STATUS
========                ======
Afrikaans (af)          not done
Basque (eu)             done
Catalan (ca)            not done
Danish (da)             draft
Dutch (nl)              done
English (en)            done
Faeroese (fo)           not done
Finnish (fi)            draft
French (fr)             done
Galician (gl)           not done
German (de)             done
Icelandic (is)          draft
Irish (ga)              not done
Italian (it)            done
Norwegian (no)          draft
Portuguese (pt)         done
Scottish (gd)           not done
Spanish (es)            done
Swedish (sv)            draft

The following is not one of the above, but there is a port for it:

Japanese (ja)           done

In the above, "not done" means that I don't have a translation, "draft" means
that I produced a mechanical translation that hasn't been checked by a native
speaker, and "done" means that the translation has been checked by a native
speaker and thus should be more stable than draft.

In addition to the above languages, I would like to get translations in
widely-known constructed and science fiction languages such as J.R.R.
Tolkien's Middle Earth Elven, Loglan, Lojban, and of course, Klingon from
"Star Trek".

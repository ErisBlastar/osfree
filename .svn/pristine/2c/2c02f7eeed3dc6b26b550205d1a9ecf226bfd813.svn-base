	If the destination stream \para{fdst} is currently positioned
	before its physical end of file, this part is overwritten, but
	not truncated, if the source stream \para{fsrc} has less bytes
	left than \para{fdst}.\par
	On return the streams are positioned behind the last read or
	written byte.\par
	For copying the maximal possible buffer is dynamically allocated.

Start logging feature 2000/01/05 ska

This feature logs, if compiled in, the command line into a file,
whenever FreeCom is started. This feature shall help to identify
calling problems with by default invalid command lines, but supported
(or ignored) by other COMMAND.COM's.

The logfile can be used for other logging purposes later, too.

The logfile is specified as an hard-coded fully-qualified filename
within CONFIG.H, see the macro LOG_FILE. This is necessary that all
entries are collected into the same file and at various times some
log entries will be written the actual location of FreeCom.COM itself
is not known. Therefore the path of the logfile cannot be derived from
the location of the executable.

In order to change the drive the logfile is created on without the
need to re-compile FreeCom, the utility PTCHLDRV (== PaTCH Logging
DRiVe) is provided. To view the current drive just run "PTCHLDRV";
to change the drive specify it on command line, e.g.: "PTCHLDRV A".

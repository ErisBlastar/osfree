<H1>Configuration file</H1>
<P>
The .CFG file format is as simple as possible: it is a plain ASCII text
file which you can edit using any editor which supports them (almost any).
Any characters after a semicolumn ';' are ignored, i.e. you can put comments
in configuration file like this:
<PRE>
; This is an comment
</PRE>
<P>
You can define sections using widely used unix-configuration-file style, i.e.
<PRE>
[section 1]
section 1 content

[section 2]
section 2 content

...
</PRE>
The word in square brackets is used to identify the configuration.
This is an example of a configuration entry:
<PRE>
[newStub]
 /ANP:0 /F+ /YDL /YXL /MRN /MLN /U-
</PRE>
<P>
As you can see, inside the section you should put any switches just like you do
on the command line. Recursive /C options are NOT ignored, so you can link
one configuration to another. Note, however, that lxLite will refuse to load
same configuration twice to avoid infinite-loop recursion, i.e.
"lxLite /c:One /c:Two /c:One" will load `One` configuration only ONCE.</P>
<P>
Every section can have multiple names, for example:</P>
<PRE>
[newStub ReplaceStub SetNewStub]
 /ANP:0 /F+ /YDL /YXL /MRN /MLN /U-
</PRE>
<P>
This section is identified by three identifiers, i.e. /c:newstub, /c:replacestub and
/c:setnewstub switches will have same effect. If section identifier begins with a /
(slash) character, it is treated as a special case: the text following the slash
is treated as a list of file masks on which this section will be applied automatically.
For example, if we want to remove stubs automatically on all .DLL files, we have to
write a configuration section like:</P>
<PRE>
[/*.dll]
 /t /zs
</PRE>

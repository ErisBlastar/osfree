sh(ort description): Call the DOS system API
lo(ng description): Calls the DOS system API interrupt 0x21. The initial
	register values passed to the system are read from the \tok{IREGS}
	structure \para{prp}. On exit,
	the register values are dumped into the same structure overwriting
	the passed-in values.
pr(erequistes): prp != NULL
va(lue): 0: Carry flag was clear on return\item else: AX register, if
	Carry flag was set. Most DOS functions use the Carry flag to
	indicate an error condition and return the error number in the
	register AX, please consult a DOS system API reference, such as
	Ralf Brown's interrupt list, for more details.

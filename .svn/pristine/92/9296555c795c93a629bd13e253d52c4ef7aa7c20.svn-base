<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: TIME [ /T ]
<LI>
EBNF: TIME [ /T ] time
</OL>

Variant 1 displays the current time, then enters a loop prompting the
user to enter a new time. The loops terminates when a valid time had
entered or the user just pressed the <TT>ENTER</TT> key.

<P>Variant 2 does not display the current time, but tries to change the
current time to the specified <ARG>time</ARG>, on failure the loop as
explained above is entered.

<P>The individual portions of a time may be sperated by at least:
dots <TT>.</TT>, colons <TT>:</TT> and forward slashes <TT>/</TT>. Other
nationally used characters may be supported, too.
If a certain number of portions are specified:
<OL>
<LI>error,
<LI>hour:minute; seconds and hundreds default to zero,
<LI>hour:minute:seconds; hundreds defaults to zero,
<LI>hour:minute:seconds.hundreds;
<LI>more than 4 portions result in an error.
</OL>

optionally. If present they alter the given time as follows:
<UL>
<LI>AM: if hour is equal to 12, it becomes 0 (midnight).
<LI>PM: f hour is greater than 12, it is incremented by 12.
</UL>

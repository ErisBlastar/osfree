MEM
===

Displays the amount of used and free memory in your system.

NOTES
-----
Displaying memory status:  FreeDOS displays extended memory only if you have
memory installed above the 1MB boundary.  FreeDOS displays expanded memory
only if it conforms to version 4.0 of the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded
Memory Specification (LIM EMS).

Allocating extended memory:  To allocate both Interrupt 15h memory and XMS
memory, use the int15 switch when you load FD(X)XMS.SYS, HIMEM.EXE or HIMEM.SYS.

Different types of memory
-------------------------
Total conventional memory is the amount of memory on your computer up to the
first 640K.  Free Conventional Memory is the amount of conventional memory
FreeDOS has for operating your computer, including the memory it needs for
itself.

Total EMS memory is the amount of expanded memory on your computer.  Free EMS
memory is the amount of expanded memory available to programs.  If you use
EMM386 to simulate expanded memory, that memory appears in these two values.

Available XMS memory is memory managed by an extended-memory manager such as
HIMEM.SYS, and available to programs that can use it.

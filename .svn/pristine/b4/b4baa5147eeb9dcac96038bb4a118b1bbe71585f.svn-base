ty(pe): 
sh(ort description): Generate a temporary file
lo(ng description): Generates the name for a temporary file with the
	specified extension and located
	within the currently effective temporary directory and creates
	this file.\par
	To create the file prevents that the same filename is generated
	by multiple programs or multiple calls to Ftmpnam(), because
	the call to the system function to create a new, non-existant
	file is the actual atomic probe, whether or not the generated filename
	is already in use.\newline
	Upon successful return the file has been closed and has no unusual
	attributes set, meaning only the 'archive' attribute is set,
	the others are cleared.\par
	The currently effective temporary directory is determined by the
	following sequence:
		\enum %TEMP%
		\enum %TMP%
		\enum %TEMPDIR%
		\enum %TMPDIR%
		\enum <current_drive>\TEMP
		\enum <current_drive>\TMP
		\enum <boot_drive>\TEMP
		\enum <boot_drive>\TMP
		\enum .\
		\enum <boot_drive>\
	\endlist
	The first directory, in which a file can be created, is considered
	the temp directory.\newline
	This function also makes sure that the path is fully-qualified.\par
	The environment variables are retreived by env_fetch().
	\par If \tok{ext == NULL || *ext == '\0'}, no extension is appended.

SYNOPSIS:
EBNF: WHICH [{ command }]
<P>Searches for the specified command(s) the same way as if it would
be specified on command line as command itself. If an executable
file is found, its path is displayed in this format:<BR>
EBNF:command <<tab>> path
<BR>The 
EBNF!: <<tab>>
 stands for the tabulator character (ASCII 9).
<BR>If the command is not found only the
EBNF!: command
 part, but neither a
EBNF!: path
 nor the
EBNF!: <<tab>>
 is displayed.
<P>Internal commands, installable commands and aliases are not found.

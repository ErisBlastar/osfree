 --- Known Bugs
     o ARBCHAR characters not handled in CHANGE command.
     o MOVE BLOCK when the marked block is in a different file to
       the current file results in deletion of 1 line fewer from
       the source file. Cursor can also be left below the Bottom of File
       marker. The first of these situations I believe is fixed.
     o move block when the target line is the last line of the screen
       causes the cursor to be positioned incorrectly
     o behaviour of prefix commands does not match XEDIT behaviour exactly
     o VERSHIFT RIGHT does not stop when it gets to the end of the zone.
     o prefix synonyms can be parsed illegally in certain circumstances.
       eg.              SET PREFIX SYNONYM r "
           followed by: SET PREFIX SYNONYM rr ""
       When 'rr' is entered in prefix are, an invalid prefix macro is
       displayed. A workaround is available; reverse the order of the
       SET commands.
     o When in XEDIT compatibility mode, attempts to paste (via external
       methods) more than 1 line into the file area results in the first
       line being correctly added, but subsequent lines are executed as
       commands on the command line.
     o in AIX version, DEFINEing ENTER has no effect.
     o Resizing window in X11 version does not reposition cursor on
       focus line correctly or handle column not now in view.
       This also can happen after SCREEN 2. This happens under some
       circumstances, not all.
     o reduce the overhead of refreshing the 2nd view of the same file
       while in split screen mode.  Only refresh when something has
       changed!
     o Resizing X11 window while in SHOWKEY, causes screen to go black.
     o MARK STREAM is incomplete.  PUT and GET of a marked stream block
       still to do.
     o Bug with CHANGE command with target of BLOCK and marked block is
       a BOX block. Suppose you have the lines below and the marked block 
       is between the | delimiters:

        before marked block |abbcdeb| after marked block
        before marked block |ydhbsbg| after marked block

       The command c/b/&&/ block * will result in

        before marked block |a&&&&cdeb| after marked block
        before marked block |ydh&&s&&g| after marked block

       The final 'b' on the first line is NOT changed when it should have
       been.
       After checking to see what KEDIT does, the whole method of changing
       strings within a BOX block is different.  KEDIT truncates those
       characters that no longer fit within the block.
     o Bug with any of the 'pseudo files' in split screen mode. If
       you have one of the 'pseudo' files (results of DIR, SHOWKEY ALL
       or REXX Output), displayed in one screen, and in the other
       execute the same command, THE will crash.
     o Detection of ncurses (particularly under Linux) needs
       improvement.  If the /usr/include/curses.h file is actually
       the ncurses' header file, add a symbolic link from
       /usr/include/curses.h to /usr/include/ncurses.h before
       running configure.
     o INPUT command when assigned to a key and hit in FILEAREA
       causes incorrect cursor positioning.
     o Implied extract functions for POINT and RESERVED should be
       changed to ensure all functions are dynamically registered.
 --- Features to add
     - support arbchar matches in change command
     - add EXTRACT /FOCUS/
     - COPY and MOVE commands to be consistent (add targets to MOVE)
     - NEXTWINDOW command to clean up before it switches to another
       view when screen is split.
     - Provide [SET] KEYBIND command.?
     - Add [SET] RANge
     - Still some cursor positioning bugs with prefix block deletes.
     - improve performance when editing large files. some improvements,
       more to be done
     - add string targets to CLOCATE and CDELETE.
     - add [SET] STREAM commands.
     - add [SET] SPAN commands.
     - add FULL option to [SET] INPUTMODE and supporting functionality
     - allow the command line to scroll to enable long commands.
     - add SET ARROW command
     - allow SET ECOLOUR A blue; ie don't require a background. In this
       case the background is taken from the line in the filearea.
     - Make syntax highlighting more efficient - use bitmask in place
       of ' ' in work[] - MHES knows what this means ;-)
     - Add remote file editing using cURL.
       eg. ====> edit ftp://server/dir/file.txt
       ftp://[username:password@]server.com:path/file.ext for local file
       ftp://[username:password@]server.com:/path/file.ext for file anywhere
       http://server/path/file.ext - no passwords here so unlikely updates
          allowed, so file would be readonly ?
       statically link libcurl.a --with-remote
       or dynamically ? issue with SSL either way!

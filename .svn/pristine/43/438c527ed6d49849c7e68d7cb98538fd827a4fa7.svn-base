he(ader files): 
lo(ng description): This variable contains a \tok{'|'} combination of the
	following macros, defined in ENVIRON.H:
	\item \tok{ENV_SHRINKBELOW}: allows to resize the environment segment
		below its last used byte (will destroy environment,
		is necessary to delete env)
	\item \tok{ENV_ALLOWMOVE}: allows to relocate environment segment
		if to grow it fails (meaning to move it into another memory
		segment)
	\item \tok{ENV_USEUMB}: when the environment segment is relocated, search
		in the UMBs first
	\item \tok{ENV_FIRSTFIT}: when the environment segment is relocated,
		 use the memory allocation strategy \em{First Fit}
	\item \tok{ENV_LASTFIT}: when the environment segment is relocated,
		use the memory allocation strategy \em{Last Fit}
	\item If both \tok{ENV_FIRSTFIT} and \tok{ENV_LASTFIT} are set,
		the behaviour is undefined
	\item If neither \tok{ENV_FIRSTFIT} nor \tok{ENV_LASTFIT} are set,
			 \em{Best Fit} is used
	\nolist
	The default settings are: deny shrinking & moving, use UMBs, best fit

To put it brief, mkfatimage creates a hdimage file for dosemu that's
pre-loaded with the files specified on the command line. It's purpose is to
remove the need to include a hdimage.dist file in the dosemu distribution
(and it saves about 100K in the .tar.gz size on the way).

I haven't done any modifications to the makefiles since they're changing all
the time anyway, but the idea is to run mkfatimage after compiling dosemu to
create a hdimage of the programs in the commands directory. An additional
benefit is that we always get the most recent versions (since they were just
compiled).

As always, comments, suggestions, etc. are welcome.

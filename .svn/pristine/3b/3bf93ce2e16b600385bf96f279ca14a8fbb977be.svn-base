<H1>Known bugs and limitations</H1>
<P>
Here are a list of executables which failed for some reasons to work
packed; avoid packing them (lxLite will do it automatically, but if you
renamed them lxLite will not recognize them).</P>
<UL>
<LI>PMJPEG. However, even IBM`s REPACK cannot repack it, so I think
this is because of either a bug in a linker used to generate it (and its
executable has a strange structure) or a kind of debug protection (executable
checksum checking?)
<LI>VX-REXX executables. The main body of such executables (REXX ciphered
code) is simply appended to a small LX stub. Such executables have an
unknown structure and after lxLite packs its stub they become completely
obsolete.
<LI>Watcom C & C++ v>=10.0. Seems that Watcom likes to append garbage to LX
files. These executables are meant for running in both OS/2 and DOS sessions
and also have a strange structure.
<LI>InterCom since it is protected from any kind of tampering.
<LI>\OS2BOOT. OS2LDR expects OS2BOOT to be in NE format.
</UL>

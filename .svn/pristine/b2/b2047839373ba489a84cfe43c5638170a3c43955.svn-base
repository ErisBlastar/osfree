 * beEraseText, the two coordinates don't specify a rectangle, but
 * rather a starting position and ending position. In other words,
 * deleting from (1,1) to (2,2) should move the text from (2,3) to the
 * end of the second row to (1,1), move line 3 up to line 2, and so on.

/* beSetScrollingRows -
 *
 * Given a pair of row numbers, this routine will set the scrolling

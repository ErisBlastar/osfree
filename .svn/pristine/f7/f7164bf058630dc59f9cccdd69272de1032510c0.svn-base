/*
 *  This file must be included by every module in our library, either
 *  directly, or indirectly via windows.h.  The contents of this file
 *  are the following types of things:
 *
 *    Platform-specific files that must be included in most/all modules.
 *    Platform-specific capability definitions (TWIN_*) that drive
 *        conditionally compiled code within the library.
 *
 *
 *  The following are the available defines that can be made for each 
 *  platform to enable/disable certain behaviour.  This overall list
 *  must be kept up to date.  If a new capability is added, check all
 *  platforms to see if the given entity should be defined for that
 *  case.
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_FPCLASS_IEEEFP_H 	[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Used to control how the MS functions fpclass() and finite()
 *	are defined, as well as supporting macros.  Currently, the
 *      only allowed method is through the <ieeefp.h> file. 
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_ISCSYM_DEFINED		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *      Set this if the platform already defines __iscsym().
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_BOOL_DEFINED		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform already defines BOOL (and the definition is
 *	compatible with the Windows definition).
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_SHORT_DEFINED		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform already defines SHORT (and the definition is
 *	compatible with the Windows definition).
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_USHORT_DEFINED		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform already defines USHORT (and the definition is
 *	compatible with the Windows definition).
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_INT_DEFINED		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform already defines INT (and the definition is
 *	compatible with the Windows definition).
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_UINT_DEFINED		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform already defines UINT (and the definition is
 *	compatible with the Windows definition).
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_LONG_DEFINED		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform already defines LONG (and the definition is
 *	compatible with the Windows definition).
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_ULONG_DEFINED		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform already defines ULONG (and the definition is
 *	compatible with the Windows definition).
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_EMPTY_MODTABLE		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform requires an empty modtable.
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_EMPTY_LSD_PRINTER		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform requires an empty lsd printer table.
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_RUNTIME_DRVTAB		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set this if the platform requires the DrvTab entries to be set
 *      at runtime.  It's ok to set this even if it's not really needed.
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_HASSTATFS		[OPTIONAL]
 *  TWIN_HASVFSSTAT		[OPTIONAL]
 *
 *	Set one or the other to determine if the operating system supports
 * 	statfs(), or vfsstat().  This is used in the XDOS emulation package
 *      to determine the size of a given filesystem, for DOS INT21 FN36.
 *
 *	Will assume existence of "sys/vms.h" if the above are not defined.
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_HASDLFCN		
 *	
 *	Set if the system supports the dlopen.
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_HASDLADDR		
 *	
 *	Set if the system exports the dlladdr() function in debugger/hash.c.
 *	NOTE: This is only supported on older linux systems.  It requires that
 *	ld.so exports the _dl_loaded_modules table, so we can walk it to resolve
 *	addresses to symbols. (Ie. read our own symbol table in memory.)
 *  
 *	The default will simple print the address, without symbolic lookup.
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_USESYSCONF		
 *  TWIN_USETIMES
 *	
 * 	Set TWIN_USESYSCONF if you must use the sysconf() function to set the
 *	time, or TWIN_USETIMES to use the times() function.  Default is 
 *	TWIN_USETIMES
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWIN_PLATFORM
 *	
 *	Set to the system name.
 *
 *	Defaults to "Unknown"
 *
 *  --------
 *  TWINRCFILE
 *	
 *	Set to the name of the users runtime configuration file. On unix, this
 *	would be .twinrc, in the users home directory.
 *
 *	Defaults to "twinrc", if not set.
 *
 *  --------
 *

# FILE:       arm.pat
# OVERVIEW:   A pattern specification for logues for the ARM architecture
#             with no hardware floating point support. An example of such
#             a processor is the StrongARM. This specification does not
#             include support for the THUMB architecture. It also assumes
#             the prologues and epilogues emitted by gcc.

# 08 Aug 01 - Brian: Created file.
# 20 Aug 01 - Cristina: fixed prologues that return "num_saved_regs" by 
#             adding a new keyword to PAL to count the number of such registers.

NAMES

    PC = 15
    LR = 14

        bl (addr)

    # A "long call" to a function done by setting the PC to a destination
    # address. This must be proceeded by an instruction that sets the LR.

# Callee prologues.
###################

    # Callee allocates space for the stack and saves registers. A standard set
    # of four registers is saved on the stack (FP, IP, LR, PC). Additional
    # non-scratch registers (r4-r11) can also be saved using the same stmfd
    # instruction. The ARM decoder.m returns the number of registers saved
    # by stmfd in the variable "num_saved_regs".

        mov ($IP, $SP);

        sub ($FP, $IP, 4);
        sub ($SP, $SP, local_vars)

    # If a double-word argument is "split" between r3 and the stack, gcc
    # reserves space on the stack to store the low-order word passed in r3
    # so that it can later read the entire argument using a doubleword load.
    CALLEE_PROLOGUE split_arg_entry local_vars num_saved_regs IS
        mov ($IP, $SP);
        stmfd_update ($SP, rn, reg-list) *num_saved_regs = POP-COUNT(reg-list);

# Callee epilogues.
###################

    # Callee returns by restoring saved registers from the stack. This includes
    # resetting PC (causing the return), SP, and FP. Additional non-scratch
    # registers (r4-r11) can also be restored using the same ldmea instruction.

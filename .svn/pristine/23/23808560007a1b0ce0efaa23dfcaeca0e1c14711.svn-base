# Jan 98 - Cristina
#	original file by Norman pentium-names.spec
#	removed all constructors dealing with floating point as per 386-core.spec.
# 2 Feb 98 - Cristina
# 	changed argument of MOVZX and MOVSX from Eaddr to Mem as per 386-core.spec.
#	toolkit emits warning for LDS, LES, LFS, LGS and LSS (10 combinations) 
#		as these names are not in this spec.  It doesn't matter as the
#		generated name for these is the right one (i.e. LDS, LES, etc).

<H1>Abstract</H1>
<P>
Some time after releasing version 1.01 of lxLite (i.e. 1.0.1) (and some
time before :-) I wrote some simple command-line utilites which greatly
simplified my life. Because apart from lxLite they don`t present nothing
interesting, I included them here for you to get them along with lxlite :-)</P>
<H2>unLock</H2>
<P>
unLock is a simple utility which allows to `unlock` application executables
which is currently in use. Normally when an executable is loaded by OS/2 its
file is open with a deny-write sharing mode. This is done because LX format
structure is designed not to swap out unused pages in executables each time
when they aren`t needed anymore, but rather to discard them. When discarded
page is needed OS/2 simply reads it again from executable.</P>
<P>
However, there is still a way to replace executables `on-the-fly` even if
they are currently running. There is an so-called `well-known undocumented`
function (which in fact means that it won`t be neccesarily supported in
future versions of OS/2) which allow to disable sharing protection on such
files. Before doing that OS/2 reads entire executable in swap file, then
page swapping is done as with usual memory. If you`ll `unlock` many running
executables at the same time you can notice an increase in swap file size.
So, this is just an temporary work-around, you have better to reboot after
doing all neccesary things on former locked files.</P>
<P>
The command-line format of unLock is much like lxLite`s, except that it
have much less options :-)</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>/R{+|-}</B>
<DD>[R]ecursive (+) file search through subdirectories. unLock will
recursively search any directories which is located below the directory
of given filemask. If multiple masks are given multiple recursive
searchs will be performed.

<DT><B>/P{+|-}</B>
<DD>Enable (+) or disable (-) pause before each file. Before each file
unLock will ask you whenever you really want to unlock the file.

<DT><B>/V{+|-}</B>
<DD>Verbose (show additional information). If verbose option is disabled
(/V-) only those messages are left on screen which displays critical
messages (i.e. errors), otherwise after each filename unLock shows the
result of unlock operation - 'unlocked' or 'sharing violation'. Note
that unLock CANNOT unlock files which are locked in some other way than
executbles.

<H2>noEA</H2>
<P>
As you probably know :-) many (in fact a lot) of files have EAs (extended
attributes), but does not need them. In fact the only thing which REALLY
needs extended attributes is your Desktop\ directory. All other files can or
can not have extended attributes - the only thing that you can lose by
removing those attributes is how that file will appear in WPS folder (size
and icon). Other type of extended attributes is those used by REXX - any
REXX program that you run at least once and which does not have ReadOnly
attribute set have some K of extended attributes attached to it. This is the
'pre-compiled' text of the REXX program, so it will run faster with that
attributes. However, if you don`t use the REXX script too often, you can
remove extended attributes from file then to set the Read-Only attribute.</P>
<P>
Note that if you have not too many EAs (say the .TYPE and the .APPTYPE EAs)
they will NOT occupy any disk space because of the wise HPFS structure. So
to use noEA you MUST know what you`re doing and whenever you needs it
(anyway, this is true for any other program :-).</P>
<P>
noEA can show a list of extended attribute names for the processed files or
remove all of them. The command-line switches are much like in all other
utilites:</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>/R{+|-}</B>
<DD>[R]ecursive (+) file search through subdirectories. noEA will recursively
search any directories which is located below the directory of given
filemask. If multiple masks are given multiple recursive searchs will be
performed.

<DT><B>/P{+|-}</B>
<DD>Enable (+) or disable (-) pause before each file. noEA will ask for
confirmation before each processed file.

<DT><B>/V{+|-}</B>
<DD>Verbose (show EAs instead of removing them).
When this switch is used noEA will display the EAs attached to processed
file and will NOT remove them.

<DT><B>/Y{+|-}</B>
<DD>Assume (+) on all queries affirmative responce.
When noEA encounters an write-locked file it warns you about this. However,
this can be annoying when doing automatical processing (i.e. calling noEA
from batch files). You can force noEA to process any files it can by
specifying this switch.

<H2>chCase</H2>
<P>
Some time ago I was finally bored of the annoying habbit of some programs
to write their files in upper case. And not only contents (almost any
program which changes config.sys tends to convert it all to upper case when I
like it to be in lower case) but filenames also. So i started this little
project as a problem-dedicated-and-easy-to-use replacement for REN command.</P>
<P>
The main ideology of chCase is to divide filename in some `parts` then to
perform some case-conversions on each part apart :-) You can define `part
separator` characters using /S"" option. By default chCase uses "." as `part
separator`. I.e. filename chcase.is.a.great.prog will be divided into parts
'chcase', 'is', 'a', 'great' and 'prog'. Further you can tell chCase to
convert first part to upper-case, second - to lower-case, third - to mixed
format (i.e. first letter in uppercase and rest in lowercase) and so on.</P>
<P>
The available options are:</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>/C{F|D}(L|U|M|A)</B>
<DD>Convert to [L]ower/[U]pper/[M]ixed/[A]s-is case. You can define multiple
`case conversion actions` - first one will be applied on the first
`part`; second - on the second `part` and so on. Last `action` will be
used for any extra encountered `parts`, so if you`ll define only one
option it will be applyed on all filename parts. Some examples:
<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR>
<TH>filename</TH>
<TH>command line</TH>
<TH>resulting filename</TH>
</TR>

</TABLE>

<DT><B>/R{+|-}</B>
<DD>[R]ecursive (+) file search through subdirectories. chCase will
recursively search any directories which are located below the directory
of given filemask. If multiple masks are given multiple recursive
searchs will be performed.

<DT><B>/P{+|-}</B>
<DD>Enable (+) or disable (-) pause before each file. Before each file
chCase will ask you whenever you really want to rename this file. The
initial and final filenames are displayed.

<DT><B>/S{%}</B>
<DD>Define separator character(s). You can use this switch in the case when
you have some files which uses some other separators, for example space
or underscore. Note that the /S switch is NOT additive i.e. any /S
switch disables the action of precedent. Even "." is cleared by /S
switch, so if you for example want to use as separators both "." and
space " " you have to define them both in a single /S switch as follows:
/S" ."

</TABLE>

<DT><B>/V{+|-}</B>
<DD>Verbose (show additional information). If you will specify /V- chcase
will leave on screen only critical messages such as errors - all others
will be cleared immediately after they succeeded.

<H2>SysIcons</H2>
<P>
This program can change system pointers. It is mainly an GUI interface to
WinSetSystemPointer() function, so don`t expect too much :-) Anyway, it has
some advanced features such as editing pointers (using OS/2 Icon Editor) and
also allows you to choose the method for storing pointers - you can either
store into INI file an reference to an external file (so you must not move or
delete them) or to store the pointer image directly (so it will occupy space
in INI file, but original files on disk can be deleted after this).</P>
<P>
The interface is quite simple; I`ll describe here only some features that
you may not understand.</P>
<P>
The Icon Filename field displays the full name of pointer file which OS/2
uses at start-up to load currently selected system pointer. If pointer is
stored directly into OS2.INI file it will say so.</P>
<P>
The "Store icon directly/Use file reference" field lets you choose the
method which SysIcons will use to store icon reference into INI file. This
will work only for those icons which you have changed AFTER setting this
button. If "Store icon directly" button is active, you can load icons and
then remove them - they will not be used by OS/2 at start-up.</P>
<P>
The "Change" button displays the standard file dialog and lets you choose
another icon instead of highlighted.</P>
<P>
The "Load Set" button lets you load an entire pointer set instead of
loading each file separately. Note that sysIcons use an different from
"System Setup->Mouse->Pointers->Load set" method: it uses an plain text file
with extension .SET which defines one or more pointer replacements; OS/2`s
setup uses hard-coded filenames (i.e. ARROW.PTR will always be the default
mouse pointer). The format of .SET file is as follows:</P>
<HR>
<PRE>
; Everything after an semicolon is ignored
; Use semicolons to include comments into .SET file
ARROW           arrow.ptr       ; This statement defines the file
                                ; containing the default mouse pointer
TEXT            text.ptr        ; -//- the text-editing pointer
WAIT            wait.ptr        ; -//- the WAIT mouse pointer
SIZE                            ; Empty lines resets pointer to default value
                                ; The SIZE pointer is valid only in OS/2 v2.x
MOVE            move.ptr        ; This is mouse pointer when moving a window
SIZENESW        sizenesw.ptr    ; arrow from North-East to South-West
SIZENWSE        sizenwse.ptr    ; North-West to South-East
SIZEWE          sizewe.ptr      ; West to East
SIZENS          sizens.ptr      ; North to South
APPLICATION     applicat.ptr    ; Default icon representing an application
INFORMATION     info.ptr        ; The icon displayed in Information messages
QUESTION        question.ptr    ; The icon displayed in Question messages
ERROR           error.ptr       ; The icon displayed in Error messages
WARNING         warning.ptr     ; The icon displayed in Warning messages
ILLEGAL         illegal.ptr     ; The Illegal Action mouse pointer
DEFFILE         file.ptr        ; The default icon representing a file (?)
DEFFOLDER       folder.ptr      ; The default icon representing a folder (?)
MULTFILE        multfile.ptr    ; Multiple-file selection icon (?)
DEFPROGRAM      program.ptr     ; The default icon representing a program
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
Along with SysIcons I supplied three sets of system pointers: two of my
own design (although some of them I collected from miscelaneous sources) and
one of an unknown author (sorry) but that I like most. Hope you like them :-)</P>
<P>
The "Edit" button stores pointer into a temporary file (if it is not a file
reference) and launches Icon Editor. After Icon Editor ends the file is
loaded back into INI file.</P>
<P>
The "Undo" button does what you expect :-) But if you moved the highlight
bar after change, you cannot undo the change anymore.</P>
<P>
The "Default" button does what you expect: it changes pointer to its
default shape.</P>
<P>
The "Quit" button is the coolest feature of my program: hope you like it
:-)</P>

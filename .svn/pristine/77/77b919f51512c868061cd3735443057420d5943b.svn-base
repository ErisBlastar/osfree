SYNOPSIS:
<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: DATE [ /D ]
<LI>
EBNF: DATE [ /D ] date
</OL>

The first variant displays the current system date, then enters a loop
prompting the user for a new date. The loop terminates, if the user
entered a valid new date or just pressed the <TT>ENTER</TT> key.

<P>The second variant does not display the current date and tries to
change the date to the specified <ARG>date</ARG>. On success the
command terminates, otherwise enters the loop explained above.

<P>The individual portions of a date may be separated by at least:
dots <TT>.</TT>, forward slashes <TT>/</TT> or dashes <TT>-</TT>.
Other nationally used characters may be supported, too.
<BR>DATE will support partial formats:
<UL>
<LI>A <EM>single numnber</EM>: specifies the day only.
<LI><EM>Two numbers</EM>: specifies the day and the month in the order
used by the national date format, which is MM/DD for American and Japanese
and DD/MM for European format.
<LI><EM>Three numbers</EM>: specifies a full date including day, month and
year in the order suitable for the national date format, which is:
<UL>
<LI>MM/DD/[CC]YY: for American,
<LI>DD/MM/[CC]YY: for European and
<LI>[CC]YY/MM/DD: for Japanese format.
</UL>
If the year portion is less than 100, the century is assumed to be 1900, if
it is greater or equal than 80; otherwise the century is 2000.
<P><EM>Note</EM>: Some European countries introduced the so-called
business date in 1996 or so, which is the same as the Japanese format;
it makes sorting of literal dates a lot easier. If FreeCOM will or will not
support it, will depend on the NLS used by DOS.
</UL>

<BR>Symbolical names of monthes are not support (yet).

The two programs tcps.cmd and tcpc.cmd are examples of a TCP server and a
TCP client.  They work together as a test for RXSOCK.DLL.  To run the
tests:

1.  Start the server by typing the following in a command window:
   [d:\data\devl\rxlibs\rxsock] regina tcps.cmd 2000

   Where 2000 is a port number for the tcps server to use.  The
   program will not return at this point.

2.  Start the client by typing the following in a different command
    window:
   [d:\data\devl\rxlibs\rxsock] regina tcpc.cmd speedy 2000

   Substitute the hostname of the machine the server is running on for
   speedy.  Use the same port number as you did for tcps.

The client and the server will then exchange data over a socket, then
both will exit.  See the Rexx code for the data exchanged.

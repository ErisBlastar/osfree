                Notes on OS/2 version of THE
                ----------------------------

If after you have extracted the OS/2 the.exe from the archive file you
find that there are no Extended Attributes associated with the.exe,
you can re-attach the EAs by running the following:

eautil the.exe the.eas /P /J /O

This takes the EAs stored in the.eas and joins them to the.exe.

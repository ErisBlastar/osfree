	The information is stored as the absolute filename to the

		#1) byte before name of file,
		#2) dot of extension of file (may be absent),
		#3) 1st byte of the stored filename.

	On:
	- appFile(): *(#1) := '\' and *(#2) := '.'; return #3
	- appName(): *(#2) := '\0'; return #1 + 1
	- appPath(): *(#1) := '\0'; return #3

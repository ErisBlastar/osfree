This bug occurs even with late jfs's (2001-06-22). Someone is not clearing the
INODE mutex before freeing it. Then when another thread allocates it, it will
block in iAlloc on WRITE_LOCK(&ip->i_rdwrlock);

Typically this occurs during "heavy" cvs activity in the Odin32 tree on
netlabs.

Found some new stuff:
 - _iSyncFS@4+151 is probably the bad boy. But, it might be _jfs_mkdir@20+188 as well.
 - setting the synctime to a very low value helps recreating the problem.

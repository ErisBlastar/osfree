.SH NAME
dbench \- Measure disk throughput for simulated netbench run
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbench
.RI [ options ] numclients
.br
.B tbench
.RI [ options ] numclients server
.B tbench_srv
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B dbench
and
.B tbench
benchmarks.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.  However,
it has fairly easy to read source code.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
Netbench is a terrible benchmark, but it's an "industry standard" and
it's what is used in the press to rate windows fileservers like Samba
and WindowsNT.
.br
Given the requirements of running netbench (60 and 150 Windows PCs all
on switched fast ethernet and a really grunty server, and a to open up
netbench to the masses.
.br
Both \fBdbench\fP and \fBtbench\fP read a load description file called
client.txt that was derived from a network sniffer dump of a real
netbench run. client.txt is about 4MB and describes the 90 thousand
operations that a netbench client does in a typical netbench run. They
parse client.txt and use it to produce the same load without having to
buy a huge lab.
.br
dbench produces only the filesystem load. It does all the same IO
calls that the smbd server in Samba would produce when confronted with
a netbench run. It does no networking calls. 
.br
tbench produces only the TCP and process load. It does the same socket
calls that smbd would do under a netbench load. It does no filesystem
calls. The idea behind tbench is to eliminate smbd from the netbench
test, as though the smbd code could be made infinately fast.
.SH OPTIONS
The \fBdbench\fP program takes a number, which indicates the number of clients to run simultaneously.  It can also take the following options:
.TP
.B \-c client.txt
Use this as the full path name of the client.txt file (the default is
/usr/share/dbench/client.txt).
.TP
.B \-s
Use synchronous file IO on all file operations.
.TP
.B \-S
Use synchronous IO for all directory operations (unlink, rmdir, mkdir
and rename).
.br
The \fBtbench\fP program takes a number, which indicates the number of
clients to run simultaneously, and a server name: \fBtbench_srv\fP
should be invoked on that server before invoking \fBtbench\fP.
\fBtbench\fP can also take the following options:
.TP
.B \-c client.txt
Use this as the full path name of the client.txt file (the default is
/usr/share/dbench/client.txt).
.TP
.B \-t option[,...]
This sets the socket options for the connection to the server.  The
options are a comma-separated list of one or more of the following:
.BR "SO_KEEPALIVE" ,
.BR "SO_REUSEADDR" ,
.BR "SO_BROADCAST" ,
.BR "SO_NODELAY" ,
.BR "SO_LOWDELAY" ,
.BR "SO_THROUGHPUT" ,
.BR "SO_SNDBUF" =number,
.BR "SO_RCVBUF" =number,
.BR "SO_SNDLOWAT" =number,
.BR "SO_RCVLOWAT" =number,
.BR "SO_SNDTIMEO" =number, and
.BR "SO_RCVTIMEO" =number.
See 
.BR socket (7)
for details about these options.
.br
The \fBtbench_srv\fP can only take one option:
.B \-t option[,...]
as documented above.

Just a few notes to get you up and running.

To get a build going you'll need several things, 
the IFS DDK Build Environment, the DDK Tools, IBM C,
and the System utilities (including link.exe).

You should have VisualAge installed and it's environment
variables set.  Then set these 3 variables:

SET DDK=d:\ddk
SET DDKTOOLS=d:\ddktools
SET IBMC=d:\ibmc

Correct the paths as neccessary.

Then run the make.cmd script, and if all goes well
you should have a fresh build of FAT32.IFS.

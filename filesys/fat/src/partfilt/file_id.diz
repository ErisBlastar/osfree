(v1.2b) Ext2flt: See linux partitions in OS/2
Makes linux partitions visable to OS/2 so
that ext2-os2.ifs (not included in archive)
can mount them. It can also make hidden
primary partitions visable to OS/2 and change
the order in which OS/2 assigns drive letters
to partitions. This is work in progress and
may still have bugs. The source is available.

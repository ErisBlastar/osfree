Version 3.1.0 released.

	converted to use autoconf to build configure script
	
		configure can now be regenerated from configure.in
	
		only tested on intel linux, have initial definitions
		included for solaris, sunos, hppa, sgi, dec, and ibm.

		These platforms will need to be verified/updated to
		be able to build correctly.

	modified tracing facility

		all api calls/returns are consistent, showing
		parameters and return values

		added additional tracing options, independently
			trace binary call/return
			trace api call/return
			trace debug, warnings, errors, or stubs
			trace console output
			
		can turn tracing on/off

		trace can be piped to a filter, use WIN_OPENLOG="-", and
		pipe the output.

		export WIN_OPENLOG=-
		win sol |grep "WARNING"

		can trace up to a certain depth of api call		

	fixed bug where local heap tries to grow > 64kb

		notepad tried to load a file > 64k

	modified rc output

		library entry point is now a macro, to allow platform
		specific initialization routines

	added more stand-alone dll's (shared libraries)
		libwinsock.so 
		libsound.so
		libddeml.so
		libkeyboard.so
		liblzexpand.so
		libmmsystem.so

		The files and functions have been removed from the library
		and put into their own subdirectories.  The library has one
		reference to sndPlaySound which has been converted to a 
		LoadLibrary;GetProcAddress pair.  To use functions in these
		libaries, it is necessary to include the appropriate -l
		to include the desired libraries.
		

	more options added to the include/platform.h file.

		Options for VMS added, as well as made many hardcoded values
		parameters, settable in this file.
	
	default ./makeinclude/setup is to build interpreter, not direct execution
	for intel linux.  Intel Linux will reset to proper values to build the
	correct files.
		

	Cleanup in general, including...

		makefile*.[lib/inc] does not use rc macro

		configure and setup...

		added RC as $(TWINDIR)/bin/rc/rc

		make depend fixed...

		-Wall default on Linux w/ gcc

		// comments removed

		add _based(x) to msclib....

		X11 libraries/headers  defaults to /usr/X11R6/lib

-------------------- README file for win16 test suite -----------------
Copyright (C) 2007 Google (Jennifer Lai and Dan Kegel)

This is a test suite for the win16 API.
All tests pass on both Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Windows 98.
They expose about five bugs in Wine-0.9.45; patches to fix these bugs
are included in the patches/ subdirectory.  Applying those patches
to Wine causes it to pass these tests.

Many of the tests are simple ports of the win32 tests in the
Wine source tree from http://winehq.org.  The original copyright
notices have been preserved, and the original path in the winehq
soure tree is noted in a comment at the top of each file.

================= Running Tests Under Wine ====================

1. Make sure Wine is on your path:
	$ wine --version
	If that fails, modify your PATH, perhaps in .bashrc, with a line like:
	$ PATH=/the/path/to/your/wine:$PATH

2. If you don't have Open Watcom currently installed, do
	$ sh install_openwatcom
	This will do an unattended full installation for you.
	No mouse click is necessary as the script will do it for you.

3.  Build and run the tests:
	$ make all
	$ make tests
	(When running, sometimes you'll run into an error that looks like:
	"*** glibc detected *** fouble free or corruption (fasttop): ***
	wine client error:36: read: Bad file descriptor",
	To get around it, rerun the test plus the rest by doing again
	$make tests .)

3.1. If you want to rerun a failed test (say, timer.c):
	$ make timer.ok

3.2. If you want to rerun a successful test:
	$ rm timer.ok
	$ make timer.ok

3.3 Logging:
	The default is to log a test's result to nameOfTest.log. So
	$make timer.ok
	will produce timer.log.
	To disable logging and see result outputted to the console window, do
	$ make timer.ok LOG=disable

4. Interpreting the results:
	In the log file, you will see test results like:
	file: 484241 tests executed (10 marked as todo, 0 failures), 0 skipped.
	This tells you how many tests have been performed, how many are marked as 
	todos
	(those failed in wine, but not Windows), and etc.

	To see a clear, summarized result after you successfully ran all tests, 
	you could do
	$cat *.log | grep failures

================= Running Tests Under Windows ====================

1. Install OpenWatcom ( *Full* Installation ) from
	http://ftp.openwatcom.org/ftp/open-watcom-c-win32-1.7.exe
2. To build the tests, cd into the test directory, and run
	win16-tests-build.bat
3. To run the tests, run
	win16-tests-run.bat
4. Interpreting the results:
	Please see step 4 above.

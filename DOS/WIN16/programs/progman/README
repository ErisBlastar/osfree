This is a Program Manager for WINE.

There is a checksum in the Microsoft `*.grp' files. I don't know how
to calculate it. Therefore the group files written by this Program Manager
cannot be used with the Microsoft Program Manager!!

To prevent overwriting original files:
If there is an existing `*.grp' file this program uses the extension
`.gr' instead.

It's possible to use an alternate `progman.ini' file by adding to
`wine.conf' something like:
[progman]
progman.ini=/my/wine/path/progman.ini

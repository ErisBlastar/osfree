Alistair's TODO List:

o	Finish the re-organisation of the code. This is mainly just renaming
	the functions. (The names got a little out of hand)

o	Break the code up into seperate files (FM, DSP, MIDI ?)

o	Add MIDI and FM support for the SB Emulation. (ie Merge the SB MIDI
	and the MPU-401 MIDI code (?) )

o	Add the remaining functionality (See /* FIXME: ....  */'s)

JOEL's Original TODO List:

There's a lot of work left to be done with sound code.  The readme
enumerates a number of flaws; some of these may need to be fixed.  Also, here's
a bunch of things that I'll save for people who know DOSEMU in and out:

o  Finish debuging, and preferably send me a patch so I can see what I did
   wrong.  Note too that if you send to icc1 the server might go bye-bye before
   I read it so save it and resend it in september when I tell you my permanant
   address

o  Add timer code.  The old FM chip has two timers.

o  Add debuging suport for sound and DMA.  Preferably print out all access to
these as well as details of DMA data transfer attempts in dma_trans().

o  Add configurablity.  Look at ../include/sound.h

o  Test it (thoughroughly, of course :-) with all your favorite games.  (After
   all, you tell the people around you, it might have intermittent problems
   and you have to make sure it works right all the time)

o  Support my Cirrus video hardware (you knew there would be a political
   announcement in here somewhere, didn't you?)

o  Write something similar to the SIG for dma.  It probably just has to
allocate some DMA buffers at boot time (study Hannu's driver), then when
you write to the device, it copies the data to the buffer and starts the DMA
controller.

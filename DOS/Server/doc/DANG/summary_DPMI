DPMI is Lutz's Baby. It's a really important part of the Emulator as far
as we are concerned, since it will allow us to run so many more programs
and, most importantly, bcc. This is the one thing that the WINE developers
want that we haven't been able to give them.

If you think you can help .... "Away you Go!" (Sorry to those non-UK folks ...
Thats a reference to a UK kids sports programme from my youth ... anyway ...
enough of this banter. You'll be wanting to know that this is all about 
DPMI ...)

The sound code provides emulation of the SB. The actual emulation provided
depends upon the support available from the kernel sound driver. Because
this is very OS dependant the driver code itself is kept in architecture
specifc files under src/arch/osname/dosext/sound/. Communication is via
a set of interface functions and the device independant structures.

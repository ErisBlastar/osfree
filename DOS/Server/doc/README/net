 Added support for multiple type handling. 
So it does type demultiplexing within dosemu.

So we are able to run telbin and pdipx/netx  simultaneously ;-)

 Changed the code for F_DRIVER_INFO. If the handle is '0', it need not
be valid handle (when input to this function).  At least CUTCP simply
set this value to zero when it requests for info for the first
time. The current code wrongly treated it as valid handle, and
returned the class of first registered type.

 Lots of clean ups required. (I have put in lots of pd_printf's.)
Need to be removed even if debug is not used because function
call within packet handler is very costly ...

<emphasis>NOTE:</emphasis> THERE ARE STILL BUGS.  The dosemu session just hangs. -- 
Usually when in CUTCP. (And specially when I open two sessions.)
What is strange is, it seems to work fine for some time even when two
sessions are opened. 
I strongly feel  it is due to new PIC code because it is used
heavily by the network code ... (especially in interactive telnet
sessions.)

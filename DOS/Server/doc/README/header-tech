<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
This documentation is derived from a number of smaller documents. This makes it
easier for individuals to maintain the documentation relevant to their area of
expertise. Previous attempts at documenting DOSEMU failed because the
documentation on a large project like this quickly becomes too much for one
person to handle.

scattered around the source directories.

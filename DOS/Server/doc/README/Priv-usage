Catalog of usages of privileges.

mhpdbg.c in mhp_close() for:
unlink(pipename_in) 
unlink(pipename_out)

reason: Because the pipe are typically created in a directory that has
        restricted writership.
fix: Remove the privelege and change the directory.

mhpdbg.c in mhp_init() for:
mkfifo(pipename_in ...)
mkfifo(pipename_out ...)
open(pipename_in ...)
open(pipename_out ..)
unlink pipename_in ...)
unlink pipename_out ...)

Reason: Fix: see above.

mhpdbgc.c in  mhp_dump_to_file() for:
enter_priv_off
open(argv[3], O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 00775);

Reason: Fix: Being careful no fix needed.

int.c in DOS_HELPER_0x53 for:
enter_priv_off()
system(...)
Reason: Fix: Being careful no fix needed.

lpt.c in printer_open() for:
enter_priv_off()
lpt[prnum].file = fopen(lpt[prpnum].dev, "a")
lpt[prnum].file = fopen(lpt[prnum].dev, "a");
Reason: Fix: Being careful no fix needed.

config.c in open_terminal_pipe() for:
enter_priv_off()
terminal_fd = DOS_SYSCALL(open(path, O_RDWR));
Reason: Fix: Being careful no fix needed.

config.c in config_init() for:
enter_priv_off()
f=open(optarg, "r")
dbg_fd = fopen(config.debugout, "w");
Reason: Fix: Being careful no fix needed.

init.c in tmpdir_init() for:
enter_priv_off()
mkdir(tmpdir, S_IREAD | S_IWRITE | S_IEXEC)

Reason: Be careful in creating a temporary directory for the mfs code.
Fix: None needed

lexer.l in enter_include_file() for:
priv_on if ("c_system")
new_yyin = fopen( fname, "r" );

Reason: We should use all our priveleges to access the global config file.
        But only user privelges to access the others.
Fix: Don't allow access to global config files when we don't have privelges.

EDLINE RENAMED TO EDLIN

EWING, NEW JERSEY, June 9, 2003 - Beginning with the new version 2.0, the
edline program has been renamed to edlin.

On Friday, June 6, 2003, Gregory Pietsch, the maintainer of FreeDOS edline,
received an e-mail from Jon Abrams, the president of Edline, LLC. His e-mail
address is <jabrams@edline.com>. Abrams requested that Pietsch modify the
name of the text editor so that it is no longer identical to the word "edline"
to avoid confusion.

EDLINE PROGRAM INTERNATIONALIZATION

EWING, NEW JERSEY, May 30, 2003 - Internationalization for the edline program
is now a matter of translating strings in a header file.

All the outputted strings and format strings for printf() and friends are in
a file called msgs.h.  All the translator has to do is translate the strings
in that file into the language of choice.  The msgs.h file has been copied to
msgs-en.h, so that the English-language messages are saved.

I still have to figure out how to copy a specific language file to msgs.h at
compile time in the ./configure script, although this should be easy to do
(crosses fingers here).

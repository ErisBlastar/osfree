ty(pe): 
sh(ort description): Enumerate all parents of a process
lo(ng description): Enumerates all parents of a process and launches
	the given function for each of them. \em{Note:} Because DOS shells
	patch their own "parent process ID", the last enumerated process is
	the shell the process was invoked by. This behaviour makes it
	unable to create full process trees known from Unix systems.\par
	If \tok{mcb == 0}, the enumeration begins with the current process;
	otherwise, the segment is probed via \tok{isPSP()} for validity.\newline
	The callback function \para{fct} must have the type \tok{MCB_WALKFUNC},
	which is a pointer to a function:\example{|}
	|int MCB_WALKFUNC(void *arg, unsigned mcb)
	The first parameter \para{arg} is the unchanged parameter \para{arg} passed
	into \tok{mcb_allParents} itself and \para{mcb} is the MCB ID of the
	enumerated process. If the callback function returns \tok{0} (zero),
	the enumeration process proceeds, otherwise it is terminated.
pr(erequistes): fct != NULL
va(lue): -1: on failure, e.g. corrupted MCB chain or invalid passed in
	\para{mcb}
	\item 0: callback function always returned \tok{0} (zero) itself and
		there is no parent for the currently enumerated process
	\item else: the value returned by the callback function, if it is
		non-zero

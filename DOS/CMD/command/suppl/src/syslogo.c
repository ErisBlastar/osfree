sh(ort description): Open the logfile
lo(ng description): Opens the logfile, hence, enable logging.\par
	The subsystem keeps track how often the logfile is opened and
	closed. The first time the logfile is opened, it is opened
	in \em{overwrite} mode (\tok{"wt"} is passed to \tok{fopen()}).
	Each time \tok{openlog()} is called, an internal counter is
	incremented. Each time \tok{closelog()} is called, this counter
	is decremented. If the counters falls to zero, the logfile
	is closed, hence, disable logging. Any call to \tok{closelog()}
	is ignored when the counter is zero. The next time \tok{openlog()}
	is called, the logfile is opened in \em{append} mode (\tok{"at"}
	is passed to \tok{fopen()}) to preserve the log messages generated
	so far.\par
	Any call to \tok{openlog()} directly or indirectly from within
	\tok{openlog()} is ignored.\par
	On error, such as out-of-memory conditions, the program is terminated
	with an appropriate error message.\par
	The parameters are preserved, eventually duplicated into the heap,
	to be used by \tok{syslog()} later on.

	mode.\par
	The read&write mode of Micro-C is heavily buggy, therefore care must
	be taken if the stream is positioned before the physical end-of-file.
	The following rules are recommended to handle R&W access savely:
	\enum Open the stream in \tok{"rw"} (old style), or \tok{"r+"}, \tok{"w+"}
	or \tok{"a+"} (ANSI style).
	\enum Immediately after to open the stream
	perform \tok{Fsetmode(FF_RD)} to bring the stream in read-only mode.
	The stream can savely be seeked now.
	\enum Enclose all functions, that actually shall write something into
	the stream, into:
	\example{|}
	|Fsetmode(stream, FF_RW);
	|// do write into stream, but NEVER seek or read or flush the stream
	|Fsetmode(stream, FF_RD);
	\endlist
	\par\em{Note:} To sequentially write the file no precausations need to
	be taken, but one cannot read from, seek into or flush a stream, that
	has the write mode enabled, savely.
	\par\em{Also note:} This function does not modify the access permissions
	granted by the system, it sticks to the logical flags kept within the
	\tok{(FILE)} structure and maintained by Micro-C's standard C library.

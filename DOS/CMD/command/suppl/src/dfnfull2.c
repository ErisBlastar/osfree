	spec and removes any dot-components in Win9x-style.\par
	Before processing the passed in path is passed through
	\tok{dfnexpand(path, NULL)}.\newline
	".." that chdir above the root directory are ignored, which is
	very Unix-like, but is not supported by all DOS applications the
	same way.\par
	In Win9x the number of dots specified how many path components to
	remove, e.g.:
	\item "." --> one == this one
	\item ".." --> two == this one and one to the left
	\item "..." --> three, e.g.: "path1\path2\path3\..." becomes "path1\"
	\item a.s.o

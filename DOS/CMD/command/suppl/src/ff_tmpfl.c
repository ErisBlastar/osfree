lo(ng description): 
	Opens a scratch (temporary) file via the the \tok{Fxopen()} call
	in overwrite, binary, read & write mode.
	This file must be closed by the \tok{Fxclose()} function in order to
	remove the file.\par
	If to open the file fails, a file named "fnam" is removed, if it
	already exists before calling this function. This is necessary, because
	this function is intended to be the back-end of \tok{Ftmpnam()}, which
	already creates the temporary file.

sh(ort description): Default value returned by Fxinfo() on failure
lo(ng description): This variable is the very first item of the chain
	of all extended attributes and will be returned by Fxinfo(), if
	the passed stream has not been opened with Fxopen(), thus,
	it has no extended attributes attached to it. This makes sure that
	functions can use the return value of Fxinfo() without to check for
	the error condition. The values of the extended attributes for
	the default item are:
	\item \tok{fp}: \tok{NULL}
	\item \tok{fnam}: \tok{Y_noFNam}, which usually expands to the
		string "<<unknown filename>>"
	\item \tok{istmp}: \tok{0}, meaning: is not a temporary file

lo(ng description): \para{newname}'s backup file is deleted, if it exists.
	Then \para{newname} is renamed into its backup filename, if it exists.
	Then \para{oldname} is renamed into \para{newname}.\par
	The name of the backup file is created with \tok{dfnbakname()}.\par
	UNC paths are supported.

wa(rning): The file cannot be renamed across filesystems.
bu(gs): On failure, the "to" / "newname" file is probably deleted, but the
	"from" / "oldname" file has not be renamed. This might lead to inconsistencies or even to loose data unless handled correctly.

ty(pe): 
sh(ort description): Read the next line from a steam
lo(ng description): 
	Read the next line from stream \para{f} into a dynamically adjusted buffer
	 The maximal length of one line must not exceed \tok{INT_MAX}.\par
	There is \em{always} a \tok{'\n'} (newline) character at the end of the
	line. That means empty lines show up as \tok{"\n"}.\par
	The user must free the buffer.\par
	No action is performed to actually detect end of line conditions,
	that means if the line is \em{not} finished with the \tok{'\n'} character,
	the behaviour is compiler-specific; but if this function recieves a
	line without an appended newline character, one is appended. Latter
	condition should be encountered only at the end of stream.
pr(erequistes): f != NULL
va(lue): 
		\tok{NULL}: memory allocation error
		\item else: pointer to dynamically allocated buffer holding the line.
			If the line is "", EOF (or a read error) was encountered.
re(lated to): Fread Fgets
se(condary subsystems): 
in(itialized by): 
wa(rning): 
bu(gs): 
		In Micro-C \tok{fgets()} does not return the \tok{'\n'} at the end of
		the line. At least in version v3.15 after reading \tok{sizeof(buf)-1}
		characters \tok{fgets()} stops and returns; thus, if the inputline
		has \em{exactly} \tok{sizeof(buf)-1} character in it, \tok{fgets()} returns
		with the buffer completely filled and leaves the \tok{'\n'} in the
		stream. The next time \tok{fgets()} is called, an empty line is
		returned. This behavious makes it possible to determine the
		end of the line on behalf of the \em{fullness} of the line,
		meaning if the buffer is filled completely, one can savely
		assume that the line continues.

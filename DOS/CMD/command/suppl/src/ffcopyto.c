ty(pe): 
sh(ort description): Copy a portion of a file into another one
lo(ng description): Copies stream \para{fsrc} beginning with the current
	position upto, but excluding the specified position \para{pos} into
	stream \para{fdst} beginning at the current position.\par
	If the destination stream \para{fdst} is positioned before
	the end of the physical file, its contents is overwritten, but
	not truncated, if it has more bytes left than are actually
	copied into.\par
pr(erequistes): fsrc != NULL && fdst != NULL && pos != NULL
va(lue): 0: on success
	\item 1: \para{fsrc} not at EOF, possible read error, not enough
		bytes in source stream, general access error \para{fsrc}
	\item 2: write error
	\item 3: out of memory
re(lated to): Fcopy Fcopybuf Fcopyi Fcopyl
se(condary subsystems): 
in(itialized by): 
wa(rning): The specified position must be a valid one returned by
	\tok{FFgetpos()} or assoc., because if the stream is opened in
	text mode and a special text handling is active, such as multi-byte
	characters, the result is unpredictable otherwise.

ob(ject): mcb_length

sh(ort description): Return the length of a memory block as \tok{(int)}
lo(ng description): Returns the length of a memory block in bytes, \em{but}
	in the range 0..65534!\par
	The specified value must be the address to the \em{memory segment} rather
	than the address of the associated MCB!
pr(erequistes): 
va(lue): 0: \tok{segm == 0} or the block is really empty
	\item \tok{0xFFFFu}: the block is larger than 64KB
	\item else: the size of the block at address \para{segm}, in range
		0..65520 bytes
re(lated to): 
se(condary subsystems): 
bu(gs): 
co(mpilers): 
wa:+ Unlike most of the functions of this subsystem the specified
	address must point to the real memory segment rather than its MCB!

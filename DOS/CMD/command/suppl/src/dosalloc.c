sh(ort description): Allocate a block of memory using the DOS API
he(ader files): 
lo(ng description): Allocates a block of memory directly via the DOS API, this
	block must be deallocated by \tok{DOSfree()} or any other function using
	the DOS API to deallocate (free) a block of memory.\par
	\para{length} specifies the size of the block to allocate in
	\em{paragraphes}. One paragraphe is a chunk of 16 bytes.\newline
	\para{mode} is a bitfield specifying what to do with UMBs. If no UMBs
	are available this setting is ignored (except for bit 0x10). Because only
	some individual combination make sense, they are enumerated:
	\item \tok{0x00}: low memory first fit
	\item \tok{0x01}: low memory best fit
	\item \tok{0x02}: low memory last fit
	\item \tok{0x0F}: use current allocation strategy
	\item \tok{0x40}: high memory first fit
	\item \tok{0x41}: high memory best fit
	\item \tok{0x42}: high memory last fit
	\item \tok{0x80}: first fit, try high then low memory
	\item \tok{0x81}: best fit, try high then low memory
	\item \tok{0x82}: last fit, try high then low memory
	\item \tok{0x8F}: make high memory accessable, but don't change strategy
	\nolist
	If bit 0x10 is set, the maximal allocateable block size is returned.\newline
	If bit 0x10 is clear, a block is allocated and its segment is returned.
	This segment is the handle to be passed back to \tok{DOSfree()} or the
	DOS API to de-allocated the memory. The far memory address can be
	generated by \tok{MK_FP(segment, 0)}.\par
	To support memory tracking utitilites, like \cmd{MEM}, the applications
	ID (eight byte name) is passed from its own memory block to the allocated
	ones.
pr(erequistes): 
va(lue): 0: on failure\item else: segment of allocated block or, if bit 0x10
	is set, the number of paragraphes of the largest unused block

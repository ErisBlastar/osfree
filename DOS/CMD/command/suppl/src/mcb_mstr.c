lo(ng description): Returns the MCB address of the master shell,
	which is the first launched shell when booting the DOS kernel.

wa:+Because DOS shells corrupt the process tree, the master shell can
	not be identified for sure the "easy" way. This function tries to
	locate the master shell by some assumptions known to be valid
	often. In the future some checks might be added when 100% working
	algorithms are known for specific environment, e.g. for specific
	shells.\par
	The algorithm used to identify the master shell performs three
	individual tests:
	\enum Use the process INT-2E points to;
		\enum Use the first shell in the MCB chain;
		\enum Use the last shell that has its environment behind its PSP.
		\endlist
	With all the memory saving programs moving their data freely through
	the memory, all three may or may not return the correct environment.\par
	Therefore, all three checks are made and the result will be assumed
	as true, which comes twice.

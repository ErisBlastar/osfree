sh(ort description): Read the next line from a FILE stream
lo(ng description): Reads the next line from a FILE stream into the heap.
	The length of the line is not directly limited, but it is
	cumulated into a dynamically allocated string. The end of a line
	is indicated by an \tok{'\n'} character or by the end-of-file
	condition. The trailing \tok{'\n'} is \em{not} removed from the string
	and one is appended if it is absent.
	On failure the program is terminates with the error message:
	"Out of memory"

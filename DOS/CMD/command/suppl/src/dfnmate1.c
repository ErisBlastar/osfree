sh(ort description): Match two extensions using DOS-style pattern match
he(ader files): 
lo(ng description): Matches two extensions, if they match each other
	honoring wildcard patterns. The following tokens are recognized:
	\item \tok{?}: any, but one character except dot or space
	\item \tok{*}: any (maybe empty) sequence of characters upto the next dot,
	a delimiter or the end of the spec
	\endlist
	The following components are recognized specifically:\newline
	\item \tok{*} and \tok{*.*}: any filename
	\item \tok{*.}: any filename with no dot in it, or a dot at the very end (meaning
		a filename without an extension)
	\endlist
	There are no assumptions how long a component is
	or which characters it is constructed of (except for the
	specially recognized characters and \tok{'\0'}), but one component should not
	contain more than one dot (except for \tok{..}). Dots may start or end
	a component.\par
	\par The pattern is assumed to start with a dot, the filename is
	skipped to the first extension dot.

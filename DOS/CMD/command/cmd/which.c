 *
 *  Comments:
 *
 *  07/15/95 (Tim Norman)
 *    started.
 *
 *  08/08/95 (Matt Rains)
 *    i have cleaned up the source code. changes now bring this source into
 *    guidelines for recommended programming practice.
 *
 *  12/12/95 (Steffan Kaiser & Tim Norman)
 *    added some patches to fix some things and make more efficient
 *
 *  1/6/96 (Tim Norman)
 *    fixed a stupid pointer mistake...  Thanks to everyone who noticed it!
 *
 *  8/1/96 (Tim Norman)
 *    fixed a bug when getenv returns NULL
 *
 *  8/7/96 (Steffan Kaiser and Tim Norman)
 *    speed improvements and bug fixes
 *
 *  8/27/96 (Tim Norman)
 *    changed code to use pointers directly into PATH environment variable
 *    rather than making our own copy.  This saves some memory, but requires
 *    we write our own function to copy pathnames out of the variable.
 *
 *  12/23/96 (Aaron Kaufman)
 *    Fixed a bug in get_paths() that did not point to the first PATH in the
 *    environment variable.
 *
 *  7/12/97 (Tim Norman)
 *    Apparently, Aaron's bugfix got lost, so I fixed it again.
 *
 *  16 July 1998 (John P. Price)
 *    Added stand alone code.
 *
 *  17 July 1998 (John P. Price)
 *    Rewrote find_which to use searchpath function
 *
 * 24-Jul-1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
 * - fixed bug where didn't check all extensions when path was specified
 *
 * 27-Jul-1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
 * - added config.h include
 *
 * 30-Jul-1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
 * - fixed so that it find_which returns NULL if filename is not executable
 *   (does not have .bat, .com, or .exe extention). Before command would
 *   to execute any file with any extension (opps!)
 *
 * 2001/02/16 ska
 * add: command WHICH

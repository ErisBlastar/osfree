name: copy
de: Copy one or more files to another location
see: ren del
req: CMD_COPY

SYNOPSIS:

<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: COPY [{ option }]  source [{ option }]  target [{ option }] 
</OL>

Copies the source file into the target file. See also: \REF{wildcards}

<P>Before parsing its command line COPY parses any <EM>option</EM> specified
by the environment variable <OPT>COPYCMD</OPT>.

STD_OPTIONS:
<UL>
<LI><OPT>/A</OPT> see below
<LI><OPT>/B</OPT>: Specifies the mode, in which the file is copied,
	<OPT>/A</OPT> forces ASCII
	and <OPT>/B</OPT> forces binary mode.
	<P>These options do alter the mode of the file immediately
	preceeding them and all following ones, until changed again.
	<P>In binary mode the file is copied and nothing is changed at all.
	<P>In ASCII mode COPY takes special care about linefeeds / newline
	characters and the end-of-line character.
	<UL>
	<LI>On read, the newline characters, which are a sequence of two
	different bytes in DOS, are transformed into a single character, as
	known from Unix-style systems. On write, this single character is
	transformed into the two-byte sequence.
	<BR>So, if both files are copied with different modes, newline
	characters are transformed into either way.
	<LI>If the end-of-file character is found on read, the remaining
	contents of the file is ignored. On write, such character is appended
	after the last character has been written.
	</UL>
	By default, files are copied in binary mode, whereas devices, e.g.
	<CMD>CON:</CMD>, are copied in ASCII mode, but no end-of-file is appended.
</UL>

ARGUMENTS:
<UL>
<LI><ARG>source</ARG>: The source file.
	<BR>If more than one source file is specified, the target must be
	a directory.

<LI><ARG>target</ARG>: The target of the COPY process.
	<BR>If target is a directory, the destination file is placed into this
	directory, but with the same filename as the source file.
	<BR>If exactly one source is specified, but no target, target defaults
	to just <CMD>.</CMD>, which represant the current directory.

</UL>

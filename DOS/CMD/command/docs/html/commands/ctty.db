name: CTTY
de: Change TTY (console)
req: CMD_CTTY

SYNOPSIS:
EBNF: CTTY device

With this command the console device can be changed. A console device performs
all basic input and output operations. This change is more complete
than <A HREF="!:redirection">IO-redirections</A>, because latter one might
not catch all output, for instance the error messages. See example 3 below.
<BR>Because the console is a bidirectional virtual device, meaning it
is to perform input <STRONG>and</STRONG> output, the specified
<ARG>device</ARG> must not a unidirectional device, such as <CMD>PRN</CMD>.
<P>To specify a second argument on the command line of FreeCOM has the
same effect.
<P><STRONG>Attention</STRONG>: This command is to effect the whole system,
not only FreeCOM itself; so the effect of CTTY does not only depend on the
implementation status of FreeCOM, but on the DOS kernel, too.
<P>Also, some programs access the screen or keyboard directly, rather than
using the DOS functions; these programs are <STRONG>not</STRONG> effected
by CTTY.

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1

CMD: CTTY aux

Changes the console to the <ARG>AUX:</ARG> device, which is usually the
first serial communication port <CMD>COM1:</CMD>. If this line is connected
to a terminal or a terminal emulator, the system can be controlled from the
terminal by now.

EXAMPLE: 2

CMD: CTTY nul
any command sequence<BR>
CMD: CTTY con

The first command discards any output. If a program attempts any input
operation, it gets none. Some programs may not handle such situation
correctly.
<BR>So, any output, even error messages, are discarded during the command
sequence.
<BR>The second command changes the console back to the screen/keyboard pair.
<BR>To display a string onto screen or read from keybord the usual
<A HREF="!:redirection">I/O-redirections</A> may be used, for instance:
<UL>
<LI>
CMD: ECHO This line appears on the screen >CON
<LI>
CMD: PAUSE >CON
This PAUSE command will get its input even within the
&quot;<CMD>CTTY nul</CMD>&quot; environment.
</UL>

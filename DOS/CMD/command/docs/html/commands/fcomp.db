DESCRIPTION:

If defined on compilation of FreeCOM and if the enhanced command line
editing is activated as well, the tabulatur key binding becomes available.

<P>When the tabulator key is pressed, the word the cursor is located
on actually or is immediately preceeding is separated and tried to
match against files, like a DIR command would do, e.g. when hitting tab
at the command line:<BR>
CMD: bar\f_ some arguments
<BR>-- where the underscore <TT>_</TT> is to mark the location of the cursor and
is <EM>no</EM> actual character -- causes FreeCOM to try to locate any
files or directories matching the filename pattern <CMD>bar\f*.*</CMD>.
<BR>If none is found, a beep is issued to indicate that error and the
command line remains unchanged.
<BR>Otherwise as many characters are appended to the filename as are
the same for all found matches, e.g.:
<BR><OL>
<LI>if exactly one match was found, its name is appened.
<LI>if, for example, the files or directories: <TT>FOO</TT>, <TT>FUU.TXT</TT>
or <TT>FUU</TT> are present in the directory <TT>BAR</TT>, no character
is appened, because there are no equal characters following the already
present <TT>f</TT> character.
<LI>if, for example, the files or directories: <TT>FOO</TT>, <TT>FOO.TXT</TT>
or <TT>FOO1.TXT</TT> are present in the directory <TT>BAR</TT>, the
two characters <TT>OO</TT> are appened, because all found matches
share these two characters immediately following the already present
characers. Hence, the command line is expanded to:<BR>
CMD: bar\FOO_ some arguments
<BR>Please note that the case of all characters will match the case
of the retrieved filenames.
</OL>
In addition, because in the cases 2 and 3 the file completion was not
complete because more than one match was found, a beep is issued.
In this situation to hit the tabulator key a second time, without
an intervueing other key press, causes to display all available matches,
but keeps the command line unchanged otherwise.
<BR>If exactly one filename match was found, hence the file completion
was complete, and if the found match is a directory, a backslash is
appended to. This allows to walk into deep levels of directories speededly.

<P>If the cursor had been placed, for instance, under the backslash
in above mentioned command line, the full string <TT>bar\f</TT> had
been tried to be completed as well. This behaviour differs from other
implementations.

OPTIONS:
Compile-time options:

matching directory entries. Default: Read-Only, Archive, Directory

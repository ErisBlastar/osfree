FreeDOS Command Line Interface Development History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2003/03/09 Tom Ehlert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
add: DIR /A** and /O***

2002/10/16 Alain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
add: COPY: keep file time

2002/04/02 Tom Ehlert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
add: XMS-Only Swap feature (FEATURE_XMS_SWAP)

2002/03/31 ska
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
chg: COPY: appFile unneccessarily declared FAR (Tom Ehlert)
bugfix: cmdinput.c: histGet(,str,maxlen) (Tom Ehlert)
bugfix: mux_ae.h: #ifdef --> #if (Tom Ehlert)
bugfix: day/month read from ff_time reversed (John Price)
bugfix: IF lower==LOWER bug; MS COMMAND compares case-sensitively
fix: Several typos in documentation

v0.83 Beta 32:
bugfix: if FREECOM.COM /P without AUTOEXEC.BAT --> assert() failure.
add: if DEBUG enabled: internal command EXIT!! that ignores /P
chg: FEATURE_BOOT_KEYS: mandory boot keys (F5/F8) turned into
	optional compile-time option; disabled by default now as the
	kernel provides F5/F8 checking
chg: some document updates

v0.83 Beta 30:
add: SET /I: To display the size and unused area in env segm
	(about 700 bytes increase of image; WILL BE REMOVED WITH NEXT
	 STABLE RELEASE)
bugfix: INIT.C/COMMAND.C: in MS DOS environment no program
	expects that the string area of an environment is used and is
	therefore killed. FreeCOM now zeroes the string counter
	in order to let SUPPL work correctly.
	Warning: Known Bug: Now test is made, if the two bytes for the
	counter is not available, thus, the env_nullStrings() function
	fails.
bugfix: INIT.C: negated test for FreeDOS's build >= 2025

v0.83 Beta 28:

possible bugfix: force to default to _unsigned_ char as built-in
	<ctype.h> macros do not work with signed char > 127

v0.83 Beta 15:
bugfix: expalias: if malloc() fails, random expanded is free'ed
bugfix: nls_maketime(): 12hour display does not free AM/PM id

20-Sep-1999 0.78 Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  chg: added v0.77 patches <<what is the print_free() stuff in DIR.C?>>
  chg: centralized DEBUG stuff (see debug.*)
  add: SET: Issues no-such-variable if a variable could not be removed
  bugfix: COPY *.C A:
  chg: automatic load of messages and keep them in memory
  add: session management
  add: comments
  add: command line scanner acts over both internal command lines and
  	arguments of COMMAND.COM itself ==> added longname options
  chg: replaced access() by dfnstat()
  chg: replaced stat() by dfnstat()
  chg: split() may recieve NULL as line --> empty line
  add: every internal command that can display some information, can
  	be called with parameter == NULL and this info is displayed.
  	cmd_echo(NULL) will display ECHO status.
  add: ECHO. hack
  chg: every internal command detects and scans the options in the
  	same way; see CMT3.TXT
  add: DEL accepts multiple arguments
  bugfix: "FOR %a IN (dir\*.*) DO" expands to "dir\..." instead of
  	just "..."
  bugfix: %9 wrong, if 9 > number of paramters
  chg: %0 returns fullname; see CMT2.TXT
  chg: rewritten COPY. Now behaves as described in CMT4.TXT

29-Apr-1999 0.77 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o dir.c: changed dir so it always shows the bytes free.
  Changed so that "dir command" with no extension will do as
  "dir command.*" (as it should).  Also made the display of the directory
  not include the whole filespec, but only the directory
o copy.c: Now works if dest is just a drive letter.
  (i.e "copy file a:")

25-Apr-1999 0.77 Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bugfix: alias.c: aliasexpand(): The main loop is multiply executed, if
	at least one alias was expanded (controlled by variable 'd').
	However, because 'ptr' is never resetted, the second loop
	always immediately fails, because 'ptr' is still NULL.
bugfix: batch.c: batch_params(): Copying a quoted argument: If the string
	is not terminated, the do-while loop stops, then copies the '\0'
	byte, then increments s2 --> s2 now behind the string.
bugfix: batch.c: batch(): fullname is duplicated into heap, but
	not freed if this function fails
bugfix: batch.c: batch(): no error checking of batch_params()
add: cmdinput.c: readcommand(): ^C: as ESC, also sets ECHO to ON
bugfix: copy.c: cmd_copy(): If malloc of sources fails, 'p' is not freed
bugfix: dir.c: cmd_dir(): dircmd can be NULL
bugfix: filecomp.c: complete_filename(): makelower undefined if count < 0
bugfix: for.c: cmd_for(): missing out-of-memory check with batch_params()
bugfix: goto.c: cmd_goto(): leave the current FOR contexts
add: command.h/misc.c: match(), matchtok(), match_() test if a word
	begins a line, if so, skip over it and following spaces
add: misc.c: comFile(): returns the absolute filename of COMMAND.COM
add: misc.c: comPathFile(): returns the name of a file located in the
	directory as COMMAND.COM
chg: init.c: ComDir: replaced by ComPath, comFile() & comPathFile()
fix: init.c: initialize(): combination of "/p" and "/c"|"/k" did not work
bugfix: command.c: process_input(): FOR hack: On command line one can
	enter "FOR %a IN () DO ...". The current implementation expanded
	the %A's.
chg: alias.c: ltrim() & rtrim() moved to MISC.C, all "skip whitespace"
	code pieces use these functions now
add: misc.c: trim(): combination of rtrim() & ltrim()
add: assert()'s to every function

24-Mar-1999 0.77 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Added support for swapable exec.  There is a compile-time directive
  so you can leave it out, or use it.  IT DOES NOT WORK UNDER
  FREEDOS.  Probably a kernel problem, but that has not been
  determined yet.
o changed the way we run autoexec.bat or a batch file on the command
  line.  This seemed to clear up some bugs with running autoexec.bat.
o Changed set command so you can use a space between the variable and
  the value.  Prints Syntax error if you don't have a space or a '='.

24-Mar-1999 0.76b Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o date.c: bugfix: detection for invalid date strings.
   Now the whole string must match: ^\s*\d+(.(\d+(.\d*)?)?)?\s*$
   The numbers can be delimited by any character from the 7-bit ASCII set,
   which is printable, but not alphanumerical.
   One need not specify all three parts (in which case the delimiter
   may be omitted, too). If one specify;
     1 number --> only the day changes
     2 numbers --> month/day; year remains unchanged
     3 numbers --> month/day/year
o time.c: bugfix: Detection of invalid time strings
   One can specify:
     ^\s*\d+.\d+(.(\d+(.\d*)?)?)?\s*([aApP]([mM]|\.[mM]\.)?\s*$
   If one specifies:
     1 number --> error
     2 numbers --> hour:minute, seconds & hundreds default to zero
     3 numbers --> hour:minute:seconds, hundreds defaults to zero
     4 numbers --> hour:minute:seconds.hundreds
   The numbers may be delimited by any character from the 7-bit ASCII set,
   which is printable, but not alphanumerical.
o err_hand.c: bugfix: Print garbage on screen, if no disk in floppy
    drive An "interrupt" function saves & restores all registers and
    also sets up DS correctly.
o created parsenum.c

11-Feb-1999 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o command.c: changed the spawnl call back to using the exec function.
  Now that we are handling the environment correctly, this seems to
  work better.  It passes new environment variables (even ones that
  were created by this copy of command.com) to the child process.
  This was suggested by Steffen Kaiser.
o using keypressed() that I wrote instead of Turbo C's kbhit()
  function because for some reason kbhit() hangs under the FreeDOS
  kernel.
o prints seconds as it waits for a keypress from user (during initial
  boot)
o Fixed path to autoexec.bat.
o Changed openStrFile() function to try to read the strings from the
  end of command first, and then to try to read strings.dat in the
  same directory as command.com.  This helps when running from the
  debugger.

01-Feb-1999 0.76 Rob Linwood <rcl@udel.edu>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o alias.c: added code to allow alias commands to contain extra
  whitespace
o added "?" command that shows the available commands.


31-Jan-1999 0.76 (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o dir.c: Changed dir_print_header to use function INT21,AH=69 instead
  of the function it was using.  I'm not sure if this will fix
  anything or not.  Also fixed bug with changing and restoring the
  current drive.
o ver.c: changed /r to identify the FreeDOS kernel.  If you are using
  kernel build 2000 or greater, it also shows the kernel version!
o init.c: when command.com is started, it shows how much memory
  command.com is not hogging!  Hopefully this will increase soon!


28-Jan-1999 0.75i (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o alias.c: Changed noalias character from a dot to an asterisk (*).


25-Jan-1999 0.75i Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o This patch includes the CP/M style device name support:
o Changed any open() and fopen() calls, when definitely sure that
  they are called for disk files only, into devopen() and fdevopen().
o Support for COPY is a hack. Rob or John should double check it, or
  possibly rewrite the whole file. (Thanx Steffen! - John :-)
  Changes in COPY.C:
  bugfix: setting time in ASCII mode before writing final ^Z
  bugfix: copy(): if bsiz < 128: the opened files are not closed
  chg: all error "return" statements perform the actions in the
       same sequence to allow the code optimizer to re-use code
  add: support for CP/M style device names (openf.h)
  chg/bugfix: overwrite(): use vcgetcstr(); could overflow the buffer
  chg: there were two individual flags ASCII and BINARY to indicate
       which option was specified. Internally only the ASCII flag was
       used, if it was clear, the files were copied in binary mode.
       To support devices the two flags are passed unchanged to the
       copy() function and, if both are clear (== none specified on
       command line), it defaults to ASCII for devices, but will not
       append the ^Z character.
       Due to this, the destination file must be opened in ASCII
       mode, too; otherwise the newline character had to be handled
       manually.
o Two new files: openf.c & openf.h


25-Jan-1999 0.75i Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o This patch addresses the two bugs reported by Eric Kohl
  <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>:
o alias.c: aliasdel(): accesses dynamic memory after it was free()'ed.
o split()'s code to skip leading whitespaces crashes at end of string.

22-Jan-1999 0.75i Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o bugfix: on suggestion of Charles Dye (raster@highfiber.com)
  "/ccommand" "/c" must work without a space between [MS COMMAND
  compatibly] also mimics: "/c/? dir" --> bad command or filename

o add: DR DOS compatibly: "/c:" and "/c=" even supports wierd
    looking: "/c:dir/?"

o add: DR DOS compatibly: "/p:AUTOEXEC_replacement"

o sub: calling _fullpath() for ComDir; at this point the path must be
  fully-qualtifed by convention of the environ

16-Dec-1998 0.75h (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o alias.c: Changed so that a dot before a command will disable alias
  expansion.  I was "noalias" but I prefer the shorter solution.

16-Dec-1998 0.75h Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o bugfix in init() for the /C branch (collecting arguments)
o tracemode interaction in parsecommandline()
o vcgetcstr() to fetch a visible user input, incl. validation check
o command line parsing now exactly as the help screen (strings.txt)
  describes
o show help screen using display_string()
o set exitflag (and exit if allowed) if help screen was issued or a
  bad option was found
o load messages into conventional far memory
o change in message.c that string_index is not allocated dynamically
o The "load messages into memory" feature allocates the block the
  messages are read into using the DOS API. It is not guarranteed
  that this block is freed by DOS upon termination of the program,
  therefore the atexit() function (installed by init()) explicitly
  frees the block, because it seems to be the best (and most secure)
  place to do so.
o is designed to work for a file STRINGS.DAT *less* than 64KB only!
o bugfix: preserve ECHO state of interactive command line (see
  TEST1.BAT)
o bugfix with infinite loop in aliasexpand() when the useFlag warps

04-Dec-1998 0.75g Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o changed dosalloc.c in the suppl library to fix the environment
  problem.

03-Dec-1998 0.75f (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o alias.c: changed to convert to lower case instead of upper
o cls.c: cls now sets the text colors to lightgray on black before
  clearing the screen.
o command.c: Added code to remove white space from end of command in
  docommand function.  Also added nextcmd char pointer so we don't
  loose the other commands in the line.  This fixes the bug
  with "type filename.c | more"
o dir.c: Rewrote DIR command.  fixed problem with "DIR .COM" and
  other bugs. Recursive switch does not work now, but it will be
  added soon.
o init.c: finished batch file trace mode.  Fixed bug with /C command
  line switch running batch files.
  Added about 2 second delay where user can press F8 to run
  autoexec.bat in tracemode, or press F5 to bypass autoexec.bat
  completely.
o messages.c: Reduced the ammount of memory allocated by not reading
  in entire index, but only the index element needed.

27-Oct-1998 0.75e Rob Green <robg@sundial.net>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o command.c: changed line in is_delim function to include backslash
  and period.

27-Oct-1998 0.75e Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o bugfix: cmd_del(): Prompting the user for "DEL ab*.*"
o chg: display_string(): Invalid FreeDOS ID is not displayed on screen
o chg: get_redirection(): join '|'-loop with the other loop
o chg: get_redirection(): allocate filenames (instead of
  parsecommand())
o bugfix: get_redirection(): Missing closing quote
o bugfix: parsecommandline(): replace tmpnam() by tmpfn() to ensure
  that the temporary file is placed into the temporary directory
  instead of the current one
o chg: alias.c: to reflect changes in tempfile.c
o chg: rmtmpfile(): to close file pointer
o chg: tempfile(): to use tmpfn()
o add: tmpfn(): to create a temporary filename

13-Sep-1998 0.75d (Hans B Pufal <hansp@digiweb.com>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o added an icon for the program.  fdcom.ico.

13-Sep-1998 0.75d (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o added VOL command.
o fixed a couple of bugs in the COPY command.
o move nearly all messages to external file that is appended to end
  of command.com.  command.com is now an EXE type program, but has
  only been renamed to .COM.  This allowed the file to be longger
  than 64K.  Also changed model to small instead of tiny.
o changed VER to print system info when /R is used.  /D shows
  redistribution info now.

13-Sep-1998 0.75d Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Corrected/rewrote ^Break handling to work on external commands.

13-Sep-1998 0.75d (Rob Lake <rlake@cs.mun.ca>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  it's a great start!

10-Aug-1998 0.75b Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Corrected ^Break handling in batch.c.  If one batch file (BATCH1)
  calls another (BATCH2), pressing ^Break or ^C most of the time asks
  to terminate BATCH1.BAT (Y/N/A). If you press 'Y', you should only
  terminate BATCH1, but BATCH2 should continue.  But if you press 'A'
  (or ^C), all batch files should terminate.
o added modifyable batch scripts (following the standard).
o bug: nested comments in old split()
o bug: DEL memory allocation
o added ^Break checks to cmd_type(), cmd_dir()
o added: chkCBreak(0) [aka "cbreak"] is a generic form that
  autodetects if currently a batchfile is active and displays the
  batchfile prompt, if so.  The batchfile prompt now displays the
  name of the batchfile.

09-Aug-1998 0.75a (Rob Lake <rlake@cs.mun.ca>)

  lock-up that happened sometimes when calling a batch file from
  another batch file.

02-Aug-1998 (Hans B Pufal) <hansp@digiweb.com>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o Terminate label on first space character, use only first 8 chars of
  label string

30-Jul-1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fixed bug where if you typed something, then hit HOME, then tried to
  type something else in insert mode, it locked up.
o Changed default insert mode to on.  There should be a way to change
  this.  Maybe options to doskey command.
o Added VERIFY command

30-Jul-1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Changed filename completion so that a second TAB displays a list of
  matching filenames!
o made filename be lower case if last character typed is lower case.
o Moved filename completion code to filecomp.c.
o Change ver command to display email address to report bugs, and the
  web page address for updates.
o fixed so that it find_which returns NULL if filename is not
  executable (does not have .bat, .com, or .exe extension).  Before
  command would to execute any file with any extension. (opps!)

29 Jul 1998 (Rob Lake rlake@cs.mun.ca)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o changed date.c and time.c, and wrote datefunc.c and timefunc.c to
  impliment _dos_getdate, _dos_setdate, _dos_gettime and _dos_settime.
  This is the first of many steps to make the shell compatible under
  Pacific C.

28 Jul 1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Added CLS command.
o Put ifdef's around all commands and added include file config.h
  Now you can define exact what commands you want to include in
  command.com.
o Also added ifdefs for optional features: aliases, command history
  and filename completion.
o Added display of available internal commands and options at startup.


20 Jul 1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)

  of the table real soon now and replacing it with a dynamic
  mechanism.

About
~~~~~
This software is part of the FreeDOS project. Please email
freedos@sunsite.unc.edu for more information, or visit the freedos
archive at "ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos".  Also,
visit our web page at http://www.freedos.org/.

The command.com web site is at

   http://freedos.sourceforge.net/freecom

Please send any bug reports, comments or other info to:

   freedos-freecom@lists.sourceforge.net   (command.com development mailing list)

This software has been developed by many people, which are enlisted
within HISTORY.TXT now.

Please note that this software is separate from the DOS-C kernel and
may or may not work properly under it.  Of course I am making every
effort to make it compatible.

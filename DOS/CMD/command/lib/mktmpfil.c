 	Try to create a temporary file in a specified directory
 	with a given extension.
 	On success the name of the temporary file is returned in a
 	dynamically allocated buffer.
 	The extension is simply appended to the randomized filename and
 	must contain the leading dot.
 *
 *  Comments:
 *    Creates unique filenames and creates the files, too.
 *    The filenames do not contain an extension, but my
 *    consume up to eight (8) characters as filename.
 *
 *    The filenames are prefixed by %TEMP%, %TMP%, %TEMPDIR%,
 *    %TMPDIR%, "\\TEMP", "\\TMP", fullpath_of("."), "<bootdrive>:\\",
 *    "."; in that order, whichever returns a writeable location first
 *
 *    The filenames are created within dymamic memory and must be
 *    free()'ed by the caller himself.
 *    The files are touched, meaning they are created with zero
 *    length and no special attributes, but closed; the caller must
 *    remove the file himself.
 *

	This file bases on TMPNAM.C of FreeCOM v0.81 beta 1.

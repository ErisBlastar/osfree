 *      Check if the passed filename is a CP/M style device
 *
 *      These device names must not contain any drive or path or
 *      extension component, but have a colon ':' at their end.
 *
 *      Return:
 *              0: no
 *              else: yes; fnam contains a valid filename now

 *      To handle CP/M style devices, like "CON:" and "LPT1:", which
 *      are not understood by the DOS kernel directly, these functions
 *      wrap the open() and fopen() functions and deal with it.
 *
 *    Also included are some low-level functions dealing with
 *    file descriptors, such as "isadev()".

	This file bases on OPENF.C of FreeCOM v0.81 beta 1.

/*
 *      Just for the algorithm:
 *              One could just transform the "XXXX:" style into
 *              "\dev\XXXX". However, WinNT DOSbox does not support
 *              this as it seems ("copy \dev\con test" says path not found).
 *
 *              On the other hand, how many other DOS clones don't support
 *              the \DEV\ prefix, too?
 *
 *      So I open the device and check the handle if it's connected to
 *      a character device rather than a block device.

To compile you need:
1) the message library,
2) the supplemental library v2.2

Target compilers: Borland C v3.1+; Micro-C v3.13

Modify the path settings in COMPILE.BAT, then run COMPILE.BAT. (requires

To compile with Borland C and DMake:
just set up the programming environment as described within the
supplemental library, then run DMAKE.

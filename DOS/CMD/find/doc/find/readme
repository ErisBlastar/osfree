This is the readme for the FreeDOS FIND program

FIND will display all lines from a text file that contain 'string'.

This program has international support using the "Cats" library
(catopen/catgets implementation for DOS).  "Cats" is distributed under
the terms of the GNU LGPL.  You can download "Cats" from
http://www.freedos.org/jhall/cats/

Update Eric Auer: Version 2.7 uses the Kitten library (by Tom Ehlert)
as a smaller replacement of Cats. Kitten is included in this archive.

Update 2.9: Now uses a special Kitten version (tuning by Eric Auer).

FIND is distributed under the GNU GPL.  See the file COPYING for
details.

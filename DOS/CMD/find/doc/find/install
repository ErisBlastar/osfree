To compile FIND 2.7 or newer:

If you have Turbo C 2.01 or newer, just type make. Otherwise, edit
the makefile before compiling. You may have to edit (or simply remove)
the turboc.cfg file to match your compiler paths.

To compile FIND 2.6 or older:

1. first, make sure you have compiled the "Cats" library for your
   system.  Be sure to use the same memory model (this trips up a lot
   of people.)

2. Then, set the CATS macro in the makefile to the *path* of the
   CATDB.LIB library file (for example, use C:\SRC\CATS not
   C:\SRC\CATS\LIB\CATS.LIB)

3. If you have Borland C, type:

   make -fmakefile.bc

That's it.


Edit the NLS\FIND.EN file to add new English messages.  Feel free to
provide translations of FIND.EN into other languages.  The new
translated files should be named FIND.xx (where "xx" is the
two-letter lang/country abbreviation.)

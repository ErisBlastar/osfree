Call to strupr() should be replaced by call to function, which will
provide support for national characters through DOS NLS. This function
will not affect interface with DOS (it uppercases file names inside), but
affect error messages. Example (if T and S are national characters):

	C>attrib dir\nametns.ext
	ATTRIB: no targets: DIR\NAMEtNs.EXt

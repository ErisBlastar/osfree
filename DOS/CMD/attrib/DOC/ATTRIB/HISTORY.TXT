1998/02/12 (plb), version 0.1
 + Initial version.

1998/02/13 (plb)
 + Started documentation.
 * Fixed bug in display_attribs where if there were no files found, the
   program exited regardless of any remaining file specifications in the
   argument list.

1998/02/18 (plb), version 0.2
 + Finished documentation.
 + Changed calls to _dos_setfileattr and _dos_getfileattr to use the
   internal function setfileattr. This function was created by me for use
   in this program; It will be submitted to the maintainer of the FreeDOS
   C Library shortly.

1998/02/22 (plb)
 + Added MS undocumented function: `attrib ,` will unset all file
   attributes.

1998/02/24 (plb), version 0.3
 + Added ability to change attributes on directories.

1998/03/08 (plb), version 0.4
 * Rewrote to be able to use file lists (ie `attrib @filename` or
   `attrib @-`) per a suggestion from Charles Dye <raster@highfiber.com>.

1998/03/16 (plb), version 0.5
 * Updated these friggin' comments :-).
 + Added a command-line parameter (`/?` in case yer interested. `-?` works
   too.) to display online help.

1998/07/19 (plb), version 0.60
 Fixed bugs:
 * If files in another directory are specified, or are on another drive,
   it will set the attributes for the appropriately names file in the
   current directory.
 * If only a drive is specified (ie `attrib d:`) it will assume `*.*` was
   meant.

1998/07/21 (plb)
 Fixed bugs:
 + In 4DOS attrib and MS-DOS attrib, if you give some attributes but no
   file names it will give all files and directories in the current
   directory those attributes. (eg `attrib +r` would set all the files
   in the current directory as read-only). This attrib didn't do that.

1998/08/29 (plb)
 Changed behavior:
 + As per a suggestion from Charles Dye <raster@highfiber.com>, specifying
   only a directory on the command line will display the attributes for
   that directory.

1998/08/30 (plb)
 Changed behavior:
 * As per a suggestion from Charles Dye <raster@highfiber.com>, it now
   ignores the directory entries `..` and `.`.

1998/09/02 (plb), version 0.63

1998/09/04 (plb), version 0.63a
 * When I released 0.63, I forgot to change the variable attrib_version
   from "0.60" to "0.63". Oops! Fixed now.

1998/09/26 (plb), version 0.64
 + Fixed a problem where ATTRIB didn't play nicely with FreeDOS.

2000/08/15 (plb), version 1.0
 There appears that no major new bugs have been reported. I'm releasing
 this as 1.0 and crossing my fingers...

2001/07/25 (ber), version 1.10
 Minor changes:
 * Changed the appearance of the online help information.
 * Cleaned up and re-ordered source code.
 + Executable is now a packed with Apack 0.99b, written by Jorgen Ibsen.
   Greetings to Jorgen Ibsen!

2001/08/07, version 1.20
 + Added subdir support. (dal)
 * Re-structured source code. (ber)

2002/08/01 (avb), version 2.0
 Bugfixes:
 * two characters targets was ignored: has_filespec wasn't assigned 1 when
   argument have two characters but not begins from '+' nor '-'.
 * target with trailing backslash or extension without name now handled
   correctly.
 * last line in file-list without CRLF now handled correctly.
 * [version 0.2] setfileattr() call intr(), which not sets `errno' and
   thus perror() reflects old (or zero) error code. Instead replacing
   intr() by intdosx(), setfileattr() replaced back to _dos_setfileattr().
 * [version 0.3] now comma clear all attributes if no attribute options
   and for all files if no other targets, else comma will be ignored (as
   in MS ATTRIB). As previously comma inside arguments will not be parsed
   (unlike MS ATTRIB, where comma inside argument also splits argument).
 - [version 0.64?] removed check for FreeDOS bug, which long ago fixed;
   with this check directory attributes in FreeDOS will not be affected.
 - [version 1.20] perror() inside set_file_attribs was not removed; this
   causes extraneous error message for each subdirectory, where required
   targets not found.
 - [version 1.20] xsplit() count as extension all after rightmost dot,
   even if file name itself not contains dot; this causes wrong parsing
   and buffer overrun.
 + [version 1.21] with checking old FreeDOS bug was removed FA_DIREC
   attribute clearing. FA_DIREC attribute clearing returned.

 Changes and additions:
 + added batch file and configuration file for compilation.
 + source cleaned and optimized; from executable removed superfluous code.
 - "Version" and "Copyright" reverted back to "VeRsIoN" and "CoPyRiGhT",
   but later deleted.
 * literals replaced by names (PATHLEN) and expressions (sizeof(line)).
 + added `D' marker for directories.
 * directories now skipped when target contains wildcards.
 + added option "/D" to include directories into search by wildcards.
 * "@" prefix replaced by "/@" option.
 + new command line parsing: comma before arguments is removed (but clears
   all attributes if no other attribute options); added support for options
   combinations ("/s/d", "+r/d") and clusters ("/sd", "+rhs/sd/@"); wrong
   attributes and options are diagnosed.
 + added strupr() for lines from file-list.
 + in lines from file-list removed enclosing spaces and quotes pair.
 + ordered errorlevels returned for each event.

 Questions:
 - missed documenation, mentioned above.

2003/07/01 (avb), version 2.1
 * slightly improved help screen.

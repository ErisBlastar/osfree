This is the source for FreeDOS diskcopy beta 0.92. To compile these file you
will need:

- nasm 0.98 (0.97 should work too).
- turbo c 2.01, turbo c++ 1.01 or compatible compiler.
- tlink.
- tlib.

So this program is completely compilable using only freely available software.
For this purpose XMS.C (from beta 0.3) has been translated to XMS.ASM.

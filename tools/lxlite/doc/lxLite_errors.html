<H1>Error messages</H1>
<P>
Like most normal programs :-) lxLite can eventually generate error
messages. Some of them can appear in similar conditions, but caused by
different causes. Here is a short list of the most frequent errors:</P>
<DL>
<DT><I>Invalid configuration file format</I>
<DD>Self-explaining, I think :-)
<DT><I>Error reading configuration file</I>
<DD>Self explaining.
<DT><I>error reading executable</I>
<DD>This is generated if executable is physically unreadable.
<DT><I>error writing executable</I>
<DD>This is generated if executable cannot be written onto disk. The cause can
be the insufficience of disk space - lxLite does not check for this
particular error.
<DT><I>invalid executable file format</I>
<DD>The file is not in [L]inear [E]xecutable. Note that you can get this
message for files with .EXE extension in the cause they are in old, 'New
Exe' (bwhahaha) format or DOS executable or winDOS executable.
<DT><I>unsupported executable format revision</I>
<DD>This error can happen (may be :-) if you try to process an executable with
other revision number than 0. OS/2 Warp works only with revision 0, so you
will not normally encounter this problem.
<DT><I>invalid word/dword ordering in executable</I>
<DD>The executable uses little-endian byte order. Seems that it is not for
Intel platform machines.
<DT><I>executable target is an unsupported CPU type</I>
<DD>This happen if the target CPU is other than 286, 386, 486 or P5.
<DT><I>executable target is an unsupported OS</I>
<DD>This mean that the executable is not for OS/2. Windos and windos 95 uses
similar format, but its magic number is not `LX` but `LE`, so usualy
program will abort with an `invalid format` error.
<DT><I>unknown entry bundle type in executable</I>
<DT><I>unknown page flags in executable</I>
<DT><I>invalid object page detected in executable</I>
<DD>It`s something about internal structure that lxLite doesnt know about.
Please mail me if you encounter such files.
<DT><I>not enough memory to load executable</I>
<DD>I doubt this error can happen in OS/2 :-) Rather a swap-file full fault
will occur. BTW, it`s a bad idea of IBM programmers to trap instead of
returning NIL pointer on a memory request :-(
<DT><I>invalid stub</I>
<DD>Stub size must be greater or equal to 64 bytes. This requirement is due to
limitation that offset to LX header must reside on the offset 60 in the
stub; however it is unlikely that you`ll got this message since lxLite will
add trailing zeros to such stubs.
<DT><I>error reading EAs</I>
<DD>Cannot explain :-)
<DT><I>error writing EAs</I>
<DD>this one too :-)
<DT><I>invalid fixup record</I>
<DD>lxLite above 1.1.8 will depack and try to re-pack fixup records. Previous
versions just read/write fixup table as a bunch of bytes; new versions will
try to see what they contain. This error can happen when converting NE
files since some of them (TFTP.EXE for example) contains so-called OSFIXUP
records that is outdated and don`t have analogue in LX executable format.
However, these executables are seldom encountered (I`ve seen only mentioned
TFTP). I don`t know an workaround for this: you cannot convert such NE
files.
<DT><I>bound application</I>
<DD>Executable is an bound application. Bound application is an NE executable
which runs both in DOS and OS/2 mode. These are NOT two different
executables bundled together (as most dual-mode programs are done: you can
do this with lxLite inserting an different DOS stub into LX executable) but
rather an tiny 'OS/2 emulator for DOS mode' binded together with NE file.
These are usually programs with the simplest possible user interface - such
as most executables from MASM 6.0 package. These executables can still be
converted by overriding this with the /NB+ option, but they won`t run in
DOS mode anymore.
<DT><I>doesn`t support long filenames</I>
<DD>Executable is not long file name - aware. NE files uses a bit in NE header
which shows whenever executables handle long file names. If it isn`t, OS/2
doesn`t show him LFN (just as for DOS programs). In some (most that I
seen) cases this is of no importance since such executables doesn`t work
with files (for example ARP.EXE or INETD.EXE from TCP/IP). You can
override this error message by using the /NL+ option.
<DT><I>incompatible segment definition</I>
<DD>NE executable contains an segment which don`t have direct analogue in LX
executable format. This is done mostly since I haven`t seen executables
with such segments (namely GDT and HUGE). If you encounter any, let me
know, please.
<DT><I>bad executable segment</I>
<DD>Executables contain an bad segment definition (either it is bigger than its
declared size, or it is partially (or fully) out of executable file). If
it works, I will be surprised :-)

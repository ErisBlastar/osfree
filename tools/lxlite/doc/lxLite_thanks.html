<H1>Thanks to:</H1>
<H3>Dmitry Goldobin</H3>
who digged from OS2LDR information regarding /EXEPACK:2 packing method; the
idea about lxLite was born when I was looking this;

<H3>Rinat Sadretinow</H3>
who gave me some ideas and informed me about some enhacements in OS/2 v4.0
regarding LX modules;

<H3>Ilfak Guilfanov</H3>
who gave me the information about new type of chained fixups in LX modules
which appeared in OS/2 v4.0.

<P>
I also would thank <H3>Herwig Bauernfeind</H3> who contributed to German translation
of the documentation; Alas the link between us is very slow, so German docs
are almost always little out of date :-) Sorry, I cannot do nothing with it.
Here is a paragraph written completely by Herwig:

<H1>Translator</H1>
<P>
As I really was very happy about Andys program, I asked whether he would
like a German translation of the documentation of version 1.01. Well, some
things sound a bit 'bumpy', but first of all, I am doing this as a hobby
only, secondly I am not professional programmer. I hope, it will help
anyway.</P>
<P>
You can reach me by email (although this is quite useless, as I
contributed the translation only):</P>

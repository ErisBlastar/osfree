lxLite compresses the files in the same way as LINK386 does. There is NO
way of implementing an effective (by memory requirements) compression method
other than those two which Warp kernel knows and will recognize (or the only
for 2.x) since unlike DOS OS/2 does paging and pages are loaded by kernel
paging mechanism which runs at ring 0. There is no documented way to intrude
inside the OS/2 kernel even from device drivers (which also runs in ring 0).
</P>
<P>
So, here is a brief description of these two algorithms:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Run-length packing. This is generally the same method that Microsoft C
for DOS uses. It gives VERY bad results because the structure of executable
files aren`t suited for that kind of packing. For example, PCX files uses
approximatively the same packing method.
<LI>Kinda Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Lempel-Ziv is the same method which almost
all DOS executables packers use - LZEXE, PKLITE, PGMPAK etc. The method
standartized for OS/2 executable files is not the most effective (IMHO).
Other thing is that OS/2 executable have a different loading algorithm in
contrast to DOS executables - parts of OS/2 executables are loaded only when
they are needed. So, Lempel-Ziv dictionary cannot cross the bound of a
single page (4096 bytes). Because of this, it gives not such good results as
it can.
</OL>
<P>
lxLite can use any of these two methods either for packing or unpacking.
Generally the second gives best compression rates, but may be (?) there are
some files on which first will work better. Because of this the default is
to try to pack page using both methods and then choose the smaller result.
lxLite can be used as well for unpacking the files that previously have been
packed - either by lxLite, LINK386 or REPACK from IBM. In some (seldom) cases
you should specify the /F (force) option to force repacking - otherwise lxLite
can give the "module is already packed" message.
</P>
<P>
What kind of files you can compress? The LX format is used almost
everywhere in OS/2: almost everything is in LX format. So, you don`t have
to limit only to .EXE files: you can pack .DLL, .PDR, .QPR, .DRV, .FON, .SYS
(Virtual Device Drivers (VDDs) in \OS2\MDOS) as well. You can run lxLite on
virtually any file: if it is not in Linear Executable (LX) format it will
fail to process it.
</P>
<P>
Versions above 1.1.7 of lxLite can also convert to LX and compress most NE
executables: this is a tricky thing but seems that in most cases it works
well. If it cannot be acomplished, lxLite will give you an error message.
If you don`t like this, you can disable this by using the /N- option on the
command line. By default lxLite will convert *only* .EXE and .DLL files, which
doesn`t contain resources, are long-filenames aware (.EXEs) and are not 
'bound executable's (.EXEs).
</P>
<P>
Some conversion considerations: NE files have a bit in the header that
shows if the module handles long file names (since OS/2 v1.0 didn`t have long
file names: HPFS was introduced in version 1.2). Executables with this bit
set will see files with LFNs, when this bit is not set whey will work just
like DOS programs do, i.e. won`t see files with LFN. Many NE executables
doesn`t have this bit set, although they don`t care at all about filenames
(for example, ARP.EXE, IFCONFIG.EXE from TCP/IP). Moreover, many executables
that even works with file names will work as well with the long file names
(for example I tried some UUENCODE/UUDECODE clones). By default lxLite will
fail to convert such files into LX since LX modules doesn`t have such a bit
in header, but you can force conversion by using the /NL switch. Default
configuration file instructs lxLite to ignore this bit for all known to me
kinds of dynamic-link libraries: DLL, DRV, FON, PDR, QPR (although last
four extensions, as far as I know, always are LX modules).
</P>
<P>
Also there is a number of NE executables (for example most EXEs from SIO or
MASM 6.0 package) which are so-called 'bounded' (also known as "Family API")
executables. A bounded executable can run both under DOS and OS/2, but not
the way as LX modules do (one file contains TWO different executables; DOS
executable is binded as stub to OS/2 LX executable), but other way: DOS stub
is a small program which loads and executes NE executable under plain DOS,
and emulates a (very) limited set of OS/2 API calls via BIOS and DOS
interrupts. By default lxLite will also fail to convert such executables
into LX modules since resulting executables won`t run under DOS anymore:
however, if you have PROTECTONLY=YES in CONFIG.SYS or simply don`t need the
executable to run under DOS, you can change the behavior of lxLite using the
/NB switch on the command line.
</P>
<P>
Another incompatibility between LX and NE files are resources. If NE
module contains resources and they`re loaded using the Dos16GetResource API
function, API will return an error code when trying to load same resources
from an LX file. So, by default, lxLite will fail to convert NE modules that
contains resources (however, there are not too much such modules). However,
you can override this by using the /NR switch. As a example of a DLL with
resources you can look at \TCPIP\DLL\TCPMRI.DLL. Many NE utilites (such as
ARP, PING etc) uses Dos16GetResource to load resources from TCPMRI.DLL, and
will display an 'Failure in national language support' instead of almost all
messages. There is an alternative API function for 16-bit modules:
DosGetResource2, which will work well for an LX file. So if you`re sure that
all resources in a file are loaded exclusively through DosLoadModule2, you
can force lxLite to convert such NE files by using the /NR switch.
</P>
<P>
lxLite version 1.00 and above can replace executable modules even if they
are currently in use. In this case it will warn you that module is already
in use by another process, and will propose you either to replace it by its
packed version or either to skip this module. Choose at your wish, but keep
in mind that the modules you have replaced are kept now (their old versions)
in memory, so they eat up your swapfile space. Better reboot as soon as you
have this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
You can also consider compressing your entire \OS2\*\ directory structure,
it will give you a lot of extra space and absolutely no overhead! The time
spent for decompressing executables is recovered by the time which system
does not spend for reading the executable from HD because it`s much smaller!
You can even compress the DLLs which are currently locked (lxLite will unlock
them, but swap file will increase, so you will need to reboot after this).
For this, you have to type:
</P>
<CITE>
lxLite #:\os2\* /r /yur
</CITE>
<P>
where # is drive letter of your boot drive.
</P>
<P>
Version 1.1.0 and above detects executables which contains some data after
the LX structure itself (i.e. what`s called in DOS overlay data). For
example Watcom`s binded executables (such as WCC.EXE versions >= 10.0) and
Watcom Visual Rexx executables have such structure. In this case lxLite
shows an warning message and asks for confirmation whenever you really want
to pack such executable. It is STRONGLY recommended that you backup the
executable in question before trying to do it because it is VERY possible
that it will become non-functional if something gets changed in it (because
lxLite does not change any of possible pointers in data binded to LX as in
VREXX executables). Default configuration file instructs lxLite to back up
automatically such executables (by using the /BX switch). All backed up
filenames are stored by default into the \lxLite.bak directory.
